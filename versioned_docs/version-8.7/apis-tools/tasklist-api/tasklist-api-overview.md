Learn the basics on how to consume the Tasklist GraphQL API. Read more about how to build a real world application [here](../tasklist-api-tutorial). Be sure to [authenticate to use the Tasklist API](./tasklist-api-authentication.md).

:::info
The GraphQL API is deprecated. To ensure a smooth transition, we'll continue to support our GraphQL API for a period of time, giving you an opportunity to migrate to the new REST API version at your own pace.

Review the [Tasklist REST API](../tasklist-api-rest/tasklist-api-rest-overview.md). The REST API offers more functionality than the GraphQL API, and a more streamlined and efficient way of interacting with our service.

## Endpoint

Tasklist provides a GraphQL API at endpoint `/graphql`.

From Camunda 8 the endpoint is `${base-url}/graphql`.

For SaaS: `https://${REGION}.tasklist.camunda.io:443/${CLUSTER_ID}/graphql`, and for Self-Managed installations: `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

## Obtaining the Tasklist schema

To obtain the Tasklist GraphQL schema, visit the API collection in [GitHub](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-api-postman-collection), which is fully functioning in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/camundateam/workspace/camunda-8-postman/collection/20317927-6394943f-b57c-4c04-acf9-391a8614103b?action=share&creator=11465105).

Alternatively, send a request to the endpoint with a GraphQL introspection query as described [here](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/), or use the [generated API documentation](/apis-tools/tasklist-api/generated.md).

There are also several [tools to explore GraphQL APIs](https://altair.sirmuel.design).

For example, you want to know about provided types:

```graphql
query {
  __schema {
    queryType {
      fields {
        name
        type {
          kind
          ofType {
            kind
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
