Authenticate to access the Tasklist API.

## Authentication in the cloud

To access the API endpoint, you need an access token.

Your client must send a header in each request:

`Authorization: Bearer <Token>`

For example, send a request using _curl_:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -d '{"query": "{tasks(query:{}){name}}"}' http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

### How to obtain the access token

You must obtain a token to use the Tasklist API. When you create a Tasklist [client](/guides/setup-client-connection-credentials.md), you get all the information needed to connect to Tasklist.

Refer to our guide on [building your own client](/apis-tools/build-your-own-client.md).

The following settings are needed:

| Name                     | Description                                     | Default value         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| client id                | Name of your registered client                  | -                     |
| client secret            | Password for your registered client             | -                     |
| audience                 | Permission name; if not given use default value | `tasklist.camunda.io` |
| authorization server url | Token issuer server                             | -                     |

Send a token issue _POST_ request to the authorization server with the following content:

```json
{
  "client_id": "<client-id>",
  "client_secret": "<client-secret>",
  "audience": "<audience>",
  "grant_type": "client_credentials"
}
```

Refer to the following example with _curl_:

```shell
curl -X POST --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"client_id": "<client-id>", "client_secret":"<client-secret>","audience":"<audience>","grant_type":"client_credentials"}' https://<authorization server url>
```

If the authentication is successful, the authorization server sends back the access token, when it expires, scope, and type:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ey...",
  "scope": "...",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## Authentication for Self-Managed cluster

### Authentication via Identity JWT access token

The authentication is described in [Tasklist Configuration - Authentication](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-authentication.md#identity).

### Authentication via cookie (Self-Managed only)

:::note
When authenticating via cookie, note that Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection must be disabled to allow this method of authentication. In a Camunda Self-Managed cluster, set the configuration property `camunda.tasklist.csrfPreventionEnabled` to `false`.
:::

Another way to access the Tasklist API in a Self-Managed cluster is to send cookie headers in each request. This works for scenarios where authentication is managed by Tasklist and not by Identity. The cookie can be obtained by using the API endpoint `/api/login`:

**Example:**

1. Log in as user 'demo' and store the cookie in the file `cookie.txt`.

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/login?username=demo&password=demo' \
   --cookie-jar cookie.txt
```

2. Send the cookie as a header in each API request. In this case, request all process definitions.

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/v1/process-definitions/search' \
   --cookie cookie.txt \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```
