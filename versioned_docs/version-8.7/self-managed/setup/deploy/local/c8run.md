:::note
Camunda 8 Run is not supported for production use.
:::

The Camunda 8 Run script allows you to install and start a simplified, single-application Camunda configuration in a local development environment. This page guides you through using Camunda 8 Run on a local or virtual machine.

Camunda 8 Run includes the following:

- Zeebe
- Operate
- Tasklist
- Connectors
- Elasticsearch

## Prerequisites

- OpenJDK 21+
- [Desktop Modeler](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md)

:::note
After installing OpenJDK, ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set by running `java -version` in a **new** terminal.

If no version of Java is found, follow your chosen installation's instructions for setting `JAVA_HOME` before continuing.
:::

## Install and start Camunda 8 Run

1. Download the [latest release of Camunda 8 Run](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/releases/tag/8.7.0-alpha3) for your operating system and architecture. Opening the .tgz file extracts the Camunda 8 Run script into a new directory.
2. Navigate to the new `c8run` directory.
3. Start Camunda 8 Run by running `./start.sh` (or `.\c8run.exe start` on Windows) in your terminal.

When successful, a new Operate window automatically opens.

:::note
If Camunda 8 Run fails to start, run the [shutdown script](#shut-down-camunda-8-run) to end the current processes, then run the start script again.

### Configuration options

The following command line arguments are available:

| Argument     | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config`   | Applies the specified Zeebe [`application.yaml`](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/configuration.md). _Not available on Windows._ |
| `--detached` | Starts Camunda 8 Run as a detached process. The process is detached by default on Windows.                                                   |

## Access Camunda components

All Camunda 8 Run components can be accessed using the username/password combination `demo`/`demo`.

Tasklist and Operate are available at:

- Tasklist: http://localhost:8080/tasklist
- Operate: http://localhost:8080/operate

The following components do not have a web interface, but the URLs may be required for additional configuration:

- Zeebe Gateway: http://localhost:26500
- Connectors: http://localhost:8085

:::note
The Connectors URL displays a login page, but cannot be logged into.
:::

### Deploy diagrams from Desktop Modeler

Make sure you have installed [Desktop Modeler](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md) before continuing.

To [deploy diagrams](/self-managed/modeler/desktop-modeler/deploy-to-self-managed.md) from Desktop Modeler, the following configuration is required:

- **Target:** Self-Managed
- **Cluster endpoint:** `http://localhost:26500`, the location of your Zeebe Gateway
- **Authentication:** None

A success notification displays when complete. [Start a new process instance](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/start-instance.md) to view your running process in Operate.

### Use built-in and custom Connectors

Desktop Modeler [automatically fetches](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/use-connectors.md#automatic-connector-template-fetching) templates for pre-built Connectors. [Custom Connectors](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md) can also be added to your Camunda 8 Run distribution.

To add a custom Connector:

1. Place the Connector's .jar file in the `/custom_connectors` folder contained in the `/c8run` directory.
2. Place the element template in the appropriate folder for your installation. See [Search Paths](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/search-paths/search-paths.md) for more information.

Once configured correctly, your Connectors are available for use in Modeler.

## Use Camunda APIs

Camunda 8 Run authenticates with the [Tasklist](/apis-tools/tasklist-api-rest/tasklist-api-rest-overview.md), [Operate](/docs/apis-tools/operate-api/overview.md), and [Zeebe](/apis-tools/zeebe-api/grpc.md) APIs, as well as the unified [Camunda 8 REST API](/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/camunda-api-rest-overview.md), by including cookie headers in each request. This cookie can be obtained by using the API endpoint `/api/login`.

To authenticate and begin making requests, take the following steps:

<Tabs groupId="api" defaultValue="v1" queryString values={
[
{label: 'Tasklist, Operate, and Zeebe', value: 'v1' },
{label: 'Camunda 8 REST API', value: 'v2' },
]}>

<TabItem value='v1'>

1. Log in as user 'demo' and store the cookie in the file `cookie.txt`:

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/login?username=demo&password=demo' \
  --cookie-jar cookie.txt
```

2. Send the cookie (as a header) in each API request. In this case, request all process definitions:

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/v1/process-definitions/search'  \
  --cookie cookie.txt \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='v2'>

:::note
Some endpoints in the [Camunda 8 REST API](/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/camunda-api-rest-overview.md) are considered [alpha features](/components/early-access/alpha/alpha-features.md), and are still in development.
:::

1. Log in as user 'demo' and store the cookie in the file `cookie.txt`:

```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/login?username=demo&password=demo' \
  --cookie-jar cookie.txt
```

2. Send the cookie (as a header) in each API request. In this case, the topology of your Zeebe cluster:

```shell
curl --cookie  cookie.txt  localhost:8080/v2/topology
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Shut down Camunda 8 Run

To shut down Camunda 8 Run and end all running processes, run `./shutdown.sh` (or `.\c8run.exe stop` on Windows) from the C8Run directory.
