By default, the [Camunda Helm chart](/self-managed/setup/install.md) does not expose the Camunda services externally. So to interact with the Camunda services inside a Kubernetes cluster without Ingress setup, you can use `kubectl port-forward` to route traffic from your local machine to the cluster. This is useful for quick tests or for development purposes.

:::note
You need to keep `port-forward` running all the time to communicate with the remote cluster.
:::

## Accessing workflow engine

To interact with Camunda workflow engine via [Zeebe Gateway](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/gateway.md) using the [Camunda 8 REST API](/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/camunda-api-rest-overview.md) or a local client/worker from outside the Kubernetes cluster, run `kubectl port-forward` to the Zeebe cluster as following:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-zeebe-gateway 26500:26500
```

Now, you can connect and execute operations against your new Zeebe cluster.

:::note
Accessing the Zeebe cluster directly using `kubectl port-forward` is recommended for development purposes.
:::

## Accessing web applications

To interact with Camunda web applications like Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize, also `kubectl port-forward` will be used.

:::note
To use the web applications without Camunda Identity, you can set `global.identity.auth.enabled: false` in the values file to disable the authentication mechanism.
Do _not_ disable it if you like to use Web Modeler, as it requires Camunda Identity and Keycloak.
:::

First, port-forward for each application service:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-operate  8081:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-tasklist 8082:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-optimize 8083:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-connectors 8088:8080

```

To be able to use Web Modeler, create additional port-forwardings for Web Modeler itself and Keycloak (assuming that Keycloak is installed as part of the Helm release):

```
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-web-modeler-webapp 8084:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-web-modeler-websockets 8085:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-keycloak 18080:80
```

To use Console, create additional port-forwardings for Console and Keycloak (assuming Keycloak is installed as part of the Helm release):

```
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-console 8087:80

kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-keycloak 18080:80
```

:::note
The name of the Keycloak service will be truncated after 20 characters if Keycloak 16 is used, for example: `svc/long-release-name-ke`
:::

Finally, you can access each app pointing your browser at:

- Operate: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Tasklist: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
- Optimize: [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
- Web Modeler: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)
- Console: [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087)

Log in to these services using the first user `demo`/`demo` credentials.

<details>
  <summary>Operate and Tasklist Login</summary>
  <div>
    <img alt="operate and tasklist login" src={require('../../setup/assets/operate-tasklist-login.png').default}/>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Operate and Tasklist Dashboard</summary>
  <div>
    <img alt="operate and tasklist dashboard" src={require('../../setup/assets/operate-tasklist-dashboard.png').default}/>
  </div>
</details>

If you deploy process definitions, they will appear in the dashboard. Then, you can drill down to see your active instances.

You can deploy and create new instances using the Zeebe clients.

You can also trigger **Connectors** inbound webhook, given you deployed one.
You can do so with the following example: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"myId": 123456, "myMessage": "Hello, world!"}' http://localhost:8088/inbound/<YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID>`.
