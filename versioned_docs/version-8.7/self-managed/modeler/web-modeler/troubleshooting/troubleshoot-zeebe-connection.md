You try to connect (i.e., to deploy) to a remote Zeebe cluster and Web Modeler reports an error.

To resolve this issue, check if you can connect to Zeebe through another client.
If that doesn't work, resolve the general connection issue first (see [the platform deployment troubleshooting section](/self-managed/operational-guides/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md), for example.)

If that works, further debug your Zeebe connection with the help of the information stated below. Enabling [debug logging in `modeler-restapi`](#how-can-i-debug-log-grpc--zeebe-communication) may also help to understand the issue.

## Zeebe connection times out

### Increase the Zeebe client timeout

Web Modeler uses the [Zeebe Java client](/apis-tools/java-client/index.md) to connect to Zeebe.
Depending on your infrastructure, the default timeouts configured may be too short.

You can pass custom timeouts in milliseconds for Web Modeler's Zeebe client to `modeler-restapi` via three individual environment variables:

```shell
ZEEBE_CLIENT_REQUESTTIMEOUT=30000 # limit the time to wait for a response from the Zeebe Gateway
ZEEBE_AUTH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=60000 # limit the time to wait for a connection to the OAuth server
ZEEBE_AUTH_READ_TIMEOUT=60000 # limits the time to wait for a response from the OAuth server
```

## Secure connection to Zeebe fails

If you provide a cluster URL starting with `https`, Web Modeler will try to establish a secure connection to
the Zeebe instance.
In the process, it strictly validates the server's Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) support and its certificates
presented against well-known certificate authorities.
Failure to connect may have several reasons:

### Configure the gateway to accept secure connections

Ensure you properly configure the remote cluster URL to accept secure connections.
Refer to the [Zeebe Gateway configuration documentation](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/security/secure-client-communication.md#gateway)
for additional information.

### Configure the gateway to support ALPN

[Inspect the connection](#how-can-i-get-details-about-a-secure-remote-connection) to understand if ALPN is supported
by the server.

Secure connections to Zeebe require an Ingress controller that supports HTTP/2 over TLS with protocol negotiation via ALPN.
Ensure you properly [configured your Zeebe ingress to support ALPN](/self-managed/operational-guides/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#zeebe-ingress-grpc).

### Configure `modeler-restapi` to trust a custom Zeebe SSL certificate

[Inspect the connection](#how-can-i-get-details-about-a-secure-remote-connection) to understand which certificates are
being returned by the server and ensure you configure Web Modeler for [custom SSL certificates](#how-can-i-provide-a-custom-zeebe-ssl-certificate).

If intermediate signing authorities sign the server certificate, ensure the remote endpoint [serves both server and
intermediate certificates](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html#chains) to Web Modeler.

### Make the OAuth token cache location writeable for the `modeler-restapi` process

When using the `OAuth` authentication method for deploying to Zeebe, Web Modeler caches OAuth tokens in a file-based
cache.
By default, the cache location is writeable by the `modeler-restapi` process.
If you run `modeler-restapi` as a non-root user (e.g. via Kubernetes' `securityContext.runAsUser` option),
you must ensure to provide a writeable cache file location to `modeler-restapi` via the `ZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable:

```shell
ZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/credentials/cache.txt
```

## How can I provide a custom Zeebe SSL certificate?

You configured a custom SSL certificate in your (remote) Zeebe deployment and want Web Modeler to accept that certificate.
Web Modeler strictly validates the remote server certificate trust chain.
If you use a custom SSL server certificate, you must make the signing CA certificate known to Web Modeler, not the
server certificate itself.

### Provide the certificate via an environment variable

`modeler-restapi` reads a trusted certificate from the environment variable `ZEEBE_CA_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.
This solution is recommended for most users:

```shell
ZEEBE_CA_CERTIFICATE_PATH=/path/to/certificate
```

The provided path has to be accessible from the `modeler-restapi` container (e.g. via a mounted volume).

### Provide the certificate to the JVM trust store

Alternatively, you may pass a custom trust store to `modeler-restapi` via the environment variable `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`:

```shell
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/truststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit"
```

Analogous to above, the provided path has to be accessible from the `modeler-restapi` container (e.g. via a mounted volume).

:::caution
Be aware that passing a custom trust store via `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` overrides the default JVM trust store.
This means that all certificates shipped by default with the Java runtime (e.g. the Amazon Trust Services CA for
connecting to a secured Aurora instance) are no longer trusted unless explicitly added.

## How can I get details about a secure remote connection?

You can use the following command to retrieve information about HTTP/2 over TLS support (ALPN) and certificates provided
by a remote endpoint:

```shell
> openssl s_client -alpn h2 -connect google.com:443 -servername google.com
[...]

## How can I debug log gRPC / Zeebe communication?

You can also start `modeler-restapi` with gRPC debug logging turned on to get detailed [logging
output](../configuration/logging.md) on communication to Zeebe:

```shell
LOGGING_LEVEL_IO_GRPC=TRACE
LOGGING_LEVEL_IO_CAMUNDA_MODELER=DEBUG
```
