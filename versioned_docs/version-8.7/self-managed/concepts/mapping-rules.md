:::info
Mapping rules are only available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed with [OIDC-based authentication](/self-managed/setup/guides/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md).
:::

Mapping rules are designed to allow you to map Camunda-specific data, such as tenants and roles, to your users by using the claims on your JWT token.

To learn more about how to configure mapping rules, see the Identity guide on [managing mapping rules](/self-managed/identity/user-guide/mapping-rules/managing-mapping-rules.md).
