title: Update 8.6 to 8.7
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.6.x to Camunda 8.7.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.6.x to 8.7.x for each component.

## Backup

### Google Cloud Storage

Configuring a non-existing bucket for backups will not prevent Zeebe to start up anymore and will only result
in logs (at WARN) in the startup phase.

## Exported records

### `USER_TASK` records

To support User Task Listeners, some backward incompatible changes were necessary to the exported `USER_TASK` records.

#### `assignee` no longer provided in `CREATING/CREATED` events

Previously, when a user task was activating with a specified `assignee`,
we appended the following events of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` property as provided

The `ASSIGNING` and `ASSIGNED` events were not appended in this case.

To support the new User Task Listeners feature, the `assignee` value will not be filled in the `CREATING` and `CREATED` events anymore.

With 8.7, the following events are now appended:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `CREATED` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `ASSIGNING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `ASSIGNED` with `assignee` property as provided

#### `ASSIGNING` has become `CLAIMING` for `CLAIM` operation

When claiming a user task, we previously appended the following records of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CLAIM`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

A new `CLAIMING` intent was introduced to distinguish between claiming and regular assigning.
We now append the following records when claiming a user task:

- `CLAIM`
- `CLAIMING`
- `ASSIGNED`

The `ASSIGNING` event is still appended for assigning a user task.
In that case, we append the following records:

- `ASSIGN`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

## REST API key attributes change to `string`

With 8.7, the default REST API key attribute type changes from `number (int64)` to `string`.

Key properties have a `key` suffix, and they serve as the technical unique identifier for entities, such as
`processDefinitionKey` and `tenantKey`, with `correlationKey` being the only exception. Their type now defaults to
`string` for the default `application/json` content type.

Our API can still work with key attributes as numbers using different content type headers.  
See the [overview about API Key Attributes][camunda8-api-overview] for more details.

:::warning Still using number keys?
If you still wish to use keys as `number (int64)` types, you have to include the
`application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json` header in your client requests.
:::

If you are using an 8.6 or 8.5 Java Client, the C8 API will recognize this and automatically return key
attributes as `integer (int64)`. You don't need to add the extra content-type header to your client requests.
