Use groups to manage user access by organizing users into groups (group members) and assigning [roles](../application-user-group-role-management/manage-roles.md). Instead of assigning roles to individual users, [map a set of roles to a group](#assign-roles-to-a-group), with all group members automatically inheriting the role permissions.
