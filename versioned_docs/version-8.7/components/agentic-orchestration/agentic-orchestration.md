[Camunda agentic orchestration](https://camunda.com/agentic-orchestration/) allows you to orchestrate AI agents within your BPMN-based workflows, enabling human tasks, deterministic rule sets, and AI-driven decisions to collaborate in a robust, end-to-end process.

Agentic orchestration ensures your AI-driven processes are efficient, compliant, and aligned with business goals.

## About agentic orchestration

Camunda agentic orchestration uses [AI agents](ai-agents.md) to execute the non-deterministic parts of a process, built on the proven foundation of BPMN. Blending both deterministic and dynamic (AI-driven) process orchestration into your end-to-end processes allows you to take advantage of non-deterministic process orchestration without sacrificing predictability, customer experience, and compliance.

For example, use an AI agent to enhance a Know Your Customer (KYC) process, where the AI agent can:

- Provide dynamic guidance and problem-solving to the person throughout the process.
- Monitor for policy changes and dynamically change the process execution in response.
- Automatically adjust risk level based on ongoing monitoring, and take action such as restricting account activity or dynamically adjusting spending limits.
