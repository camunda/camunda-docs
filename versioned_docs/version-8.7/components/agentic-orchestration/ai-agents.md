## About AI agents

<p><img src={AgentImg} title="An AI agent in a process" alt="An AI agent in a process"  className="img-transparent" style={{border:0,padding:0,paddingLeft:30,paddingTop:10,margin:0,marginLeft:10,float: 'right', width: '45%'}}/>An AI agent is a software program that autonomously gathers data and carries out tasks using this information, independently or on behalf of another system or person.</p>

- AI agents can perform a variety of functions, including making decisions, solving problems, interacting with external environments, and taking actions.

- For example, you can use an AI agent to select and execute tasks within an ad-hoc sub-process, by evaluating the current process context and determining the relevant tasks and tools to use in response.

## AI agent integration features

Use the following Camunda 8 features to integrate AI agents into your processes:

| Type            | Feature                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
