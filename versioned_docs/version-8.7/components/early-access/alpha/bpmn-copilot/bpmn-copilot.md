Using AI, users can now chat with the BPMN Copilot for assistance generating new BPMN process diagrams in [Web Modeler](/components/modeler/web-modeler/launch-web-modeler.md) based on a process description.

## Get started

:::warning
Creating a BPMN process diagram with the BPMN Copilot will overwrite existing work.
:::

To use the BPMN Copilot in Web Modeler, take the following steps:

1. If you have not yet already, [opt in](/components/console/manage-organization/enable-alpha-features.md#enable-ai-powered-features) to use this feature.
2. Log in to [Web Modeler](/components/modeler/web-modeler/launch-web-modeler.md).
3. Click **New project > Create new > BPMN diagram**. The Camunda Copilot chat window will open.

4. In the chat box, enter your prompt. This prompt should be a simple, clear, and concise request describing the BPMN diagram you would like to generate. For example, "Generate a mortgage loan process diagram". Note that more complex requests may take longer to process.
5. Wait for your diagram to generate; this takes about 50 seconds. Once complete, the Copilot will then respond with an outline of the process it created.

:::note

Timeouts may occur at this step if your query is too complex.

### Example prompts

- "Create an absence request diagram"
- "Design a process that uses data objects to drive process logic, showing how data influences process flow and decisions"
- "Model a complex service orchestration process involving multiple service tasks, conditional routing, and parallel execution of tasks"
- "Create a service order management process for a telco company. The process starts with a fraud check. First, calculate price dimensions via a script task, then check if the price dimensions are normal or high with an exclusive gateway. If high, escalate to a fraud investigation subprocess."
- Paste existing text documentation of a process or of process requirements (for example, a Confluence page)
- Paste a process hard-coded in any language (for example, BPEL, Java, COBOL, Python)
- Paste a description of a diagram. Any LLM (like ChatGPT) can generate this description from a screenshot or an image of the diagram.

## Follow-up prompts

The BPMN Copilot can also translate business-focused intent into actionable changes for the diagram it creates. For example:

- "Modify this process to maximize its changes of adhering to a 1 day SLA"
- "Reduce the operating cost of this process"
- "Show me ways to integrate AI into the process"
- "Consider unhappy paths as well"
- "Add error handling"
- "Improve the user experience"

:::note
Requesting specific modifications to one or several sections of the BPMN diagram may impact unrelated sections.
:::

### Limitations

- The BPMN Copilot officially supports only modifying diagrams that were created by the BPMN Copilot itself. It does not officially support modifying other existing diagrams (including diagrams with implementation details).
- The BPMN Copilot does not support pools, lanes, and collaborations.
