- A generic Fiori app for starting BPMN processes and displaying [Camunda Forms](/components/modeler/forms/camunda-forms-reference.md) in the Fiori design language.
- The select exposure of SAP BTP services to [BPMN tasks](/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn.md) and vice versa.
- A generic endpoint to start BPMN processes with.
