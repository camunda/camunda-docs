A **separator** element is used to create a visual separation between two elements.

<img src="/img/form-icons/form-separator.svg" alt="Form Separator Symbol" />

## Usage

The separator element is typically utilized when you want to visually distinguish between form elements. For example, you could use a separator line to delineate different sections of form fields, create a visual break between a heading and subsequent content, or to clarify the boundaries between various parts of a form.

Incorporating separators can aid in generating more organized and easier-to-read layouts, particularly in intricate forms or pages featuring multiple sections.
