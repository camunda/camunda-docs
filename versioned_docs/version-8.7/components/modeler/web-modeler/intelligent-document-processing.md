Use intelligent document processing (IDP) to integrate automated document processing into your end-to-end processes.

## About IDP

IDP uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify, extract, and organize data from your structured and unstructured documents into a structured format you can use in your processes.

For example, you can use IDP to extract data from invoices and other document types in your document processing workflow.

## Configure IDP

[Configure IDP](idp/idp-configuration.md) for your Camunda 8 setup to make sure IDP can access the required components and credentials.

:::note
IDP is only supported for Camunda 8 SaaS with the 8.7.0-alpha5 release. Support for Camunda 8 Self-Managed and Camunda 8 Run is planned for delivery with the 8.7 release.

## Get started with IDP

Once configured, you can start using IDP in your processes:

1. Create an [IDP application](idp/idp-applications.md) in which to store and manage a set of related IDP projects.

1. Create and publish a [document extraction](idp/idp-document-extraction.md) template for each type of document you want to extract data from.

1. [Integrate your published document extraction template](idp/idp-integrate.md) into your processes in Web Modeler.

<!-- 1. Create and publish your IDP projects in your IDP application folder:

   - Create a [document extraction](idp/idp-document-extraction.md) project to identify and extract data from a single type of document (for example, an invoice).

   - Create a [document automation](idp/idp-document-automation.md) project to automatically extract data from larger, more complex documents (for example, a multi-page PDF document made up of many types of documents and data). This project type is based on and requires one or more linked document extraction project(s). -->
