Use intelligent document processing (IDP) to integrate automated document processing into your end-to-end processes.

## About IDP

IDP uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify, extract, and organize data from your structured and unstructured documents into a structured format you can use in your processes.

For example, you can use IDP to extract data from invoices and other document types in your document processing workflow.

## Configure IDP

[Configure IDP](idp/idp-configuration.md) for your Camunda 8 setup with access to the required components and credentials.

<IdpGrid idp={configCards} />

## Get started with IDP

Once initial [configuration](idp/idp-configuration.md#configure-idp) is complete, get started with IDP.

<IdpGrid idp={gettingStartedCards} />

<!-- 1. Create and publish your IDP projects in your IDP application folder:

   - Create a [document extraction](idp/idp-document-extraction.md) project to identify and extract data from a single type of document (for example, an invoice).

   - Create a [document automation](idp/idp-document-automation.md) project to automatically extract data from larger, more complex documents (for example, a multi-page PDF document made up of many types of documents and data). This project type is based on and requires one or more linked document extraction project(s). -->

## IDP concepts

Learn about key [IDP concepts](idp/idp-key-concepts.md) and terms, such as the difference between structured and unstructured documents, document classification, and how IDP uses LLM Foundation models.

## IDP reference

Technical [IDP reference](idp/idp-reference.md) information, including technical architecture and document storage, supported documents and types, and extraction models.
