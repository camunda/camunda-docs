Navigate to the Web Modeler settings to configure email notifications and the process application deployment policy.
You can find the settings by clicking on your user icon in the top right corner of the Web Modeler and selecting **Settings**.

## Email notifications

Configure the projects for which you will receive email notifications when a collaborator mentions you in a comment.

## Process application deployment

Organization admins can configure the deployment policy for process applications in the Web Modeler settings.

<Tabs groupId="deployment-permissions" defaultValue="saas" queryString values={
[
{label: 'SaaS', value: 'saas' },
{label: 'Self-Managed', value: 'self-managed' },
]}>

<TabItem value='saas'>

By default, only organization administrators can deploy process applications to clusters marked as
[production stages](/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-application-pipeline.md#deployment-pipeline-stages) from Web Modeler.

You can change this in the **process application deployment** settings.
There, you can enable non-admin users with deployment permission to deploy process application versions to production stage clusters
after a collaborator has reviewed and approved the process application version using the
[process application review](/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-application-pipeline.md#review) feature.
This setting can only be configured by organization admins and applies to all process applications in the organization.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='self-managed'>

By default, only users with the **Web Modeler Admin** role can deploy process applications to
clusters marked as [production stages](/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-application-pipeline.md#deployment-pipeline-stages) from Web Modeler.

You can change this in the **Process application deployment** settings.
There, you can enable non-admin users with deployment permission to deploy process application versions to production stage clusters
after a collaborator has reviewed and approved the process application version using the
[process application review](/docs/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-application-pipeline.md#review) feature.
This setting can only be configured by users with the **Web Modeler Admin** role and applies to all process applications.

If the **Web Modeler Admin** role is not pre-existing, it can be created with the following permissions:

- Web Modeler Internal API - `write:*`
- Web Modeler Internal API - `admin:*`
- Web Modeler Internal API - `admin:*`
- Camunda Identity Resource Server - `read:users`

Refer to the documentation pages about [assigning roles](../../../self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) and [adding permissions](../../../self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-permission.md) for detailed instructions.

</Tabs>

:::info
The deployment policy applies only to deployments of **process applications** made from Web Modeler.
Deployments made from, e.g., Desktop Modeler and deployments of, e.g., single BPMN files, are not affected by this setting.
