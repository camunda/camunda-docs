description: Integrate legacy applications into Camunda with robotic process automation (RPA).
---

Use Robotic process automation (RPA) to integrate legacy systems without APIs into your Camunda processes.

## About RPA

RPA allows you to automate manual, repetitive tasks by interacting with legacy mainframe applications, desktop applications such as ERP systems, or websites that do not expose APIs.

Camunda uses RPA to integrate legacy applications without accessible APIs into your process orchestration.

## Get started with RPA

Camunda RPA uses a standalone RPA worker and Robot Framework–based scripts. This setup lets you build and run RPA scripts that integrate with your existing Camunda components.

:::tip
Before you begin, review the [RPA known issues](https://github.com/camunda/rpa-worker/discussions/categories/known-issues) to check environment compatibility.
:::

To start building RPA scripts, see [Get started with RPA](./getting-started.md).
