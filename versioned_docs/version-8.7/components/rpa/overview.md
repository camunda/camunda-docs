description: "Integrate Legacy Applications into Camunda with Robotic Process Automation (RPA)."
---

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) allows you to automate manual, repetitive tasks by interacting with Legacy Mainframe applications, desktop applications such as ERP systems, or websites without exposed APIs, for example. Camunda uses RPA to facilitate the integration of legacy applications without accessible APIs into your process orchestration.

## Get started with RPA

Camunda's RPA functionality is built around a standalone RPA worker and [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)-based RPA scripts. This setup allows users to develop and execute RPA scripts that integrate seamlessly with existing Camunda stacks.

Check out the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) or read up on setting up your workers for [production use cases](./production.md).

You can also find additional details on RPA and leave feedback via the [RPA product roadmap](https://roadmap.camunda.com/c/212-rpa-1-0).
