User groups are a way to organize users in the system. Use them to manage access to user tasks via [user task restrictions](user-task-access-restrictions.md).

## Creating a group

To create a group, navigate to the **Organization** section of Console and click on the **Groups** tab.

![Groups Management](../assets/access-control/group-management.png)

Click **Create a group** and enter the name of the group.

To add users to a group, navigate to the **Organization** section of Console and click **Users > Assign members**.

![Groups Members](../assets/access-control/group-members.png)

Select the user you want to add to a group and click **Assign**.

## User task access restrictions

You can restrict user task access in [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md) to assigned users or user group candidates.

For example, if a task has a candidate group named `Team A` and a candidate user named `example`, only the users that belong to `Team A` and the user `example` will have access to the task.

To learn more, visit the [user task access restrictions documentation](/components/concepts/access-control/user-task-access-restrictions.md).
