5. Click **Create process KPI**.
6. (Optional) Edit the created KPI report and define your own filters/extra configuration.

## Setting existing process reports as KPIs

Existing process reports can be configured to act as a KPI. This can be done through the report configuration panel.
The checkbox to make the report a KPI is only visible for reports with a number visualization.

Once a report is set as a KPI, its status is visible on the **Dashboards** page.
