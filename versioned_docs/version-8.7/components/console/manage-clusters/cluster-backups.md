If your organization works within Camunda's [Enterprise](https://camunda.com/enterprise/) plan, you can create a manual and scheduled [backups](/components/concepts/backups.md) of your cluster.

:::caution
Only the three most recent successful backups of each type are kept, meaning you can have three manual and three scheduled backups. If you already have three backups of a type, the oldest backup is automatically removed.
