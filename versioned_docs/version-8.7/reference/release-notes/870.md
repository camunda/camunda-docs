#### Deployment stages

Predefined deployment stages for process applications are now also available in Web Modeler Self-Managed.

- Select your dev, test, stage, and prod clusters to ensure process applications flow easily and predictably through your deployment pipeline.
- For added control, do not assign a stage or prod environment to enable rapid iteration in Web Modeler while still ensuring deployments run through your approved pipeline.

#### Simplified deployment

The deployment experience for Enterprise customers running Web Modeler Self-Managed is simplified.

- During Camunda installation, you can configure your Helm chart to decide which clusters are available from Web Modeler by default, and save their connection information.
- With this setup, you only need to select a cluster, and add secrets and a tenant ID as required.
