## Amazon Web Services (AWS) region support <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

You can choose to host your Camunda 8 SaaS clusters in two new Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions:

- Frankfurt, Europe (eu-central-1)
- North America, Virginia (us-east-1)

You can select one of these AWS regions when [creating a new cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md). You can continue to choose from our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) region options.

To learn more about available Camunda 8 SaaS regions, see [regions](../regions.md).

:::note

The following limitations currently apply for AWS regions:

- Backups are stored on GCP.
- HTTP connectors continue to route through GCP.

## Web Modeler

### Deploy diagram change <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span> {#web-modeler-deploy-diagram-change}

With this version, we ship a breaking change to how Web Modeler **Deploy diagram** modals work. Clusters must now be proactively [configured](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from Web Modeler.

<img src={DeployDiagramImg} alt="New 8.7 deploy diagram modal" width="600px" style={{border: '0', paddingTop: '0', marginTop: '0'}} />

- In 8.6, you could still configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal when deploying.
- In 8.7, you can no longer configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal. You must [configure the cluster](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from this modal.
- Note that you must also be assigned the `Zeebe` [Identity role](/docs/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) to be able to deploy.

### Milestones renamed to versions {#web-modeler-milestones-renamed-to-versions}

The term "milestones" has been renamed to ["versions"](/components/modeler/web-modeler/versions.md) in Web Modeler for clarity and consistency with other Camunda 8 components. The renaming is implemented across the Web Modeler user interface and the API.

In [the API](/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/index.md), new endpoints starting with `/api/v1/versions` have been introduced, while the previous `/api/v1/milestones` endpoints are now deprecated.
Further details can be found in [Web Modeler's OpenAPI documentation](https://modeler.camunda.io/swagger-ui/index.html).

:::note
This is a nominal update and the functionality of versions and milestones is equivalent.

## Southeast Asia region for SaaS customers <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

SaaS customers can now create orchestration clusters in the [Singapore (asia-southeast1) region](/reference/regions.md), ensuring lower latency and improved processing speed for organizations operating in southeast Asian countries.

## Breaking changes in Camunda Process Test

In version 8.6, the element assertions use names to identify the BPMN elements. Starting with version 8.7, the [element assertions](/apis-tools/testing/assertions.md#with-bpmn-element-id) use BPMN element IDs instead of names. This change eases the migration of previous testing frameworks and aligns with other APIs.

If you prefer to stay with element names, you can use the new [element selector](/apis-tools/testing/assertions.md#with-element-selector) `io.camunda.process.test.api.assertions.ElementSelectors#byName`.

To migrate all your test cases at once, change the [default element selector](/apis-tools/testing/assertions.md#element-selector) in the configuration.

### Deprecated: OpenAPI entities with `integer (int64)` key attributes

OpenAPI entities containing keys of type `integer (int64)` are now being deprecated.
This is part of a transition where API entity keys change from type `integer (int64)` to `string`.

See the [overview about API Key Attributes][camunda8-api-overview] for more details.
