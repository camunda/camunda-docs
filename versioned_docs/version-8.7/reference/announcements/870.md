## Amazon Web Services (AWS) region support <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

You can choose to host your Camunda 8 SaaS clusters in two new Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions:

- Frankfurt, Europe (eu-central-1)
- North America, Virginia (us-east-1)

You can select one of these AWS regions when [creating a new cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md). You can continue to choose from our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) region options.

To learn more about available Camunda 8 SaaS regions, see [regions](../regions.md).

:::note

The following limitations currently apply for AWS regions:

- Backups are stored on GCP.
- HTTP connectors continue to route through GCP.

## Web Modeler

### Deploy diagram change <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span> {#web-modeler-deploy-diagram-change}

With this version, we ship a breaking change to how Web Modeler **Deploy diagram** modals work. Clusters must now be proactively [configured](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from Web Modeler.

<img src={DeployDiagramImg} alt="New 8.7 deploy diagram modal" width="600px" style={{border: '0', paddingTop: '0', marginTop: '0'}} />

- In 8.6, you could still configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal when deploying.
- In 8.7, you can no longer configure cluster details on the **Deploy diagram** modal. You must [configure the cluster](/docs/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) to be able to deploy from this modal.
- Note that you must also be assigned the `Zeebe` [Identity role](/docs/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) to be able to deploy.

### Milestones renamed to versions {#web-modeler-milestones-renamed-to-versions}

The term "milestones" has been renamed to ["versions"](/components/modeler/web-modeler/versions.md) in Web Modeler for clarity and consistency with other Camunda 8 components. The renaming is implemented across the Web Modeler user interface and the API.

In [the API](/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/index.md), new endpoints starting with `/api/v1/versions` have been introduced, while the previous `/api/v1/milestones` endpoints are now deprecated.
Further details can be found in [Web Modeler's OpenAPI documentation](https://modeler.camunda.io/swagger-ui/index.html).

:::note
This is a nominal update and the functionality of versions and milestones is equivalent.

## Southeast Asia region for SaaS customers <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

SaaS customers can now create orchestration clusters in the [Singapore (asia-southeast1) region](/reference/regions.md), ensuring lower latency and improved processing speed for organizations operating in southeast Asian countries.
