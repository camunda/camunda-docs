### Notice 11

#### Publication date

April 17, 2023

#### Product affected

Tasklist

#### Impact

The REST API functionality of Tasklist 8.2.0 and 8.2.1 allows unauthenticated access to the following methods/URLs:

- GET /v1/tasks/\{taskId}
- POST /v1/tasks/search
- POST /v1/tasks/\{taskId}/variables/search
- POST /v1/forms/\{formId}
- POST /v1/variables/\{variableId}

Find more information about the methods in our [Tasklist REST API documentation](/apis-tools/tasklist-api-rest/tasklist-api-rest-overview.md).

Therefore, if you use Tasklist 8.2.0 or 8.2.1, and if you have sensible data stored in process variables (accessed by user tasks), this data could have been accessed by users knowing the endpoint of the Tasklist instance without authentication.

#### How to determine if the installation is affected

You are using Tasklist version 8.2.0 or 8.2.1.

#### Solution

Camunda has provided the following releases which contain a fix

- [Tasklist 8.2.2](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform/releases/tag/8.2.2)
