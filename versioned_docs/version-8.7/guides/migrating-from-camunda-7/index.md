Learn how to migrate process solutions developed for Camunda 7 to run on Camunda 8.

## About this guide

This guide covers the typical migration journey from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8, describing the decisions to be made along the way, as well as linking to more in-depth material or tooling you might find useful.

It is important to understand that **Camunda 8 is not a drop-in replacement for Camunda 7**.

It is not sufficient to exchange a library; you might have to adjust your BPMN models, refactor code, and probably also re-architect your solution. This effort greatly depends on how your existing Camunda 7 solution is built. This guide dives deeper into all the aspects involved.

:::note
This guide covers [migration tooling](migration-tooling.md) in development for Camunda 8.8 that might not be complete at the time of reading.
