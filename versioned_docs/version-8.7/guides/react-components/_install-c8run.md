### Install and start Camunda 8 Run

1. Download the [latest release of Camunda 8 Run](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/releases/tag/8.7.0-alpha4) for your operating system and architecture. Opening the .tgz file extracts the Camunda 8 Run script into a new directory.
2. Navigate to the new `c8run` directory.
3. Start Camunda 8 Run by running `./start.sh` (or `.\c8run.exe start` on Windows) in your terminal.

When successful, a new Operate window automatically opens.

:::note
If Camunda 8 Run fails to start, run the [shutdown script](/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/c8run.md#shut-down-camunda-8-run) to end the current processes, then run the start script again.

Mac users may encounter the warning `"c8run" Not Opened`. Follow the Apple support instructions to [grant an exception](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).

For more information and local configuration options, see the [Camunda 8 Run installation guide](/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/c8run.md).
