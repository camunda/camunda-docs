Any executable process needs a **BPMN diagram** that must be designed and configured beforehand. The design is used to specify the flow of a process. Thereby different events have to be configured in the model so that the workflow engine understands what is to be executed in this step.

A configuration can be the conditions in a gateway or the specification of a service task.

Camunda offers three tools for this:

- [Cawemo](https://cawemo.com/),
- the [Cloud Modeler](./cloud-modeler/launch-cloud-modeler.md), and
- the [Camunda Modeler](./camunda-modeler/install-the-modeler.md).

Cawemo focuses on the design phase and provides options for collaborative work on a BPMN model. The Cloud Modeler and the Camunda Modeler support the technical parameterization of the models. It is possible to design the model in Cawemo and then continue working with the Cloud Modeler or Camunda Modeler.

The Cloud Modeler and the Camunda Modeler differ mainly in their environment. The Camunda Modeler is a desktop application that can be installed and used locally. The Cloud Modeler is part of the Cloud Console and offers a seamless integration into Camunda Cloud.
