Google Kubernetes Engine ([GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine))
is a managed container service to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud or on-premises.

Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster using [Helm charts](../deploy.md), like GKE. However, there are a few pitfalls to avoid as described below.

## GKE cluster specification

Generally speaking, the GKE cluster specification depends on your needs and workloads.
Here is a recommended start to run Camunda 8:

- Instance type: `n1-standard-4` (4 vCPUs, 15 GB Memory)
- Number of nodes: `4`
- Volume type: `Performance (SSD) persistent disks`

## Pitfalls to avoid

For general deployment pitfalls, visit the [deployment troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting.md).

### Volume performance

To have a proper performance in Camunda 8, the persistent volumes attached to Zeebe should have around 1,000-3,000 IOPS. The `Performance (SSD) persistent disks` volumes deliver a consistent baseline IOPS performance but it [varies based on volume size](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#performance_factors).

It's recommended to use `Performance (SSD) persistent disks` volume type with at least `100 GB` per volume to have 3,000 IOPS.

### Zeebe Ingress

Zeebe requires an Ingress controller that supports `gRPC`, so if you are using [GKE Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress) (ingress-gce), not [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx), you might need to do extra steps. Namely, using `cloud.google.com/app-protocols` annotation in Zeebe Service. For more details, visit the GKE guide [using HTTP/2 for load balancing with Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ingress-http2).

### Google Cloud load balancer

Camunda Identity management endpoints, such as the health check endpoint, do not run on port 80. As a result, when using a Google Cloud Load Balancer, you may need a [custom health check configuration](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ingress-configuration#direct_health).

Hereâ€™s an example of a `BackendConfig` you can apply:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: camunda-identity
spec:
  healthCheck:
    timeoutSec: 3
    type: HTTP
    requestPath: /actuator/health/readiness
    port: 82
```

When using [container-native load balancing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/container-native-load-balancing), the load balancer sends traffic to an endpoint in a network endpoint group; hence, the `targetPort` should match the `containerPort` as the load balancer sends probes to the Pod's IP address directly.

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: camunda-identity
spec:
  healthCheck:
    timeoutSec: 3
    type: HTTP
    requestPath: /actuator/health/readiness
    port: 8082
```

Finally, in your Helm values, assign the `BackendConfig` to the Identity service.

```yaml
identity:
  service:
    annotations:
      cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"default": "camunda-identity"}'
```
