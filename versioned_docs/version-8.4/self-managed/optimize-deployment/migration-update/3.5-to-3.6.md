- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in the supported environments
- Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

## Known issues

### Default tenants

If you have [default tenants configured](./../configuration/system-configuration-platform-7.md) for any connected engine in Optimize,
it might be that user task and flow node reports, as well as branch analysis, stops showing data after updating to 3.6.0.

This is a known
issue that has been fixed as part of the 3.6.3 patch release. You can update from 3.6.0 to 3.6.3. Migration from either of these versions to
3.7.0 will be possible.

## Changes in supported environments

### Camunda 7

Optimize now requires at least Camunda 7 `7.14.0` and supports up to `7.16.0+`. Camunda 7 `7.13.x` is not supported anymore.

See the [Supported Environments](/reference/supported-environments.md) sections for the full range of supported versions.
