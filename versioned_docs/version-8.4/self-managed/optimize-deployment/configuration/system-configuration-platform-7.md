Configuration for engines used to import data.

:::note
You have to have
at least one engine configured at all times. You can configure multiple engines
to import data from. Each engine configuration should have a unique alias associated
with it and represented by `${engineAlias}`.
:::

Note that each connected engine must have its respective history level set to `FULL` in order to see all available data
in Optimize. Using any other history level will result in less data and/or functionality within Optimize. Furthermore,
history in a connected engine should be configured for long enough for Optimize to import it. If data is removed from an
engine before Optimize has imported it, that data will not be available in Optimize.
