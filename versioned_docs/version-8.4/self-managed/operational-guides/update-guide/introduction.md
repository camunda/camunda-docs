These documents guide you through the process of updating your Camunda 8
application or server installation from one Camunda 8 version to the other.

:::note
When updating from one minor version to the next, you do not need to update to each **patch** version along the way. However, do not skip **minor** versions when updating.
:::

Depending on your amount of data, run a minor version for at least 24 hours before updating to the next version.
