## Update

See the [update guide](/self-managed/operational-guides/update-guide/introduction.md) for specific instructions per Zeebe version.

To upgrade a Zeebe cluster, take the following steps:

1. Shut down all Zeebe brokers and other components of the system.
1. Take a [backup](./backups.md) of your Zeebe brokers and Elasticsearch `data` folder if used.
1. Upgrade all Zeebe brokers and gateways to the new version.
1. Restart the system components.

## Partitions admin endpoint

This endpoint allows querying the status of the partitions and performing operations to prepare an update.

The endpoint is available under `http://{zeebe-broker}:{zeebe.broker.network.monitoringApi.port}/actuator/partitions` (default port: `9600`).

It is enabled by default. It can be disabled in the configuration by setting:

```
management.endpoint.partitions.enabled=false
```

### Query the partition status

The status of the partitions can be queried with a `GET` request:

```
/actuator/partitions
```

The response contains all partitions of the broker mapped to the partition-id.
