For Enterprise plan customers, Camunda supports integrating external identity providers (IdPs). Therefore, users within your organization do not need to sign up by creating an account with Camunda.

## Onboarding procedure

We currently support both SAML and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). As this requires changes in our environment, first raise a ticket in the [support queue](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/).

### SAML

After opening the ticket in the support queue, we will provide you:

- **Assertion Customer URL**: e.g. `https://weblogin.cloud.camunda.io/login/callback?connection=CUSTOMER_CONNECTION`
- **Entity ID**: e.g. `urn:auth0:camunda:CUSTOMER_CONNECTION`

You will then need to provide:

- The domain used for the login email addresses
- A sign-in URL
- A x509 signing certificate

### Azure AD

For Azure AD, you will need to provide:

- The domain used for the login email addresses
- The Microsoft Azure AD domain
- The generated client id
- The client secret value

To generate the client on your end, you will need to use the Camunda **Redirect URL** `https://weblogin.cloud.camunda.io/login/callback `. Ensure you attach the user permissions `Users > User.Read`.

### Additional information

In some situations, you might need to access `openid-configuration` to establish the connection from your end. See [this OpenID configuration](https://weblogin.cloud.camunda.io/.well-known/openid-configuration) as an example.
