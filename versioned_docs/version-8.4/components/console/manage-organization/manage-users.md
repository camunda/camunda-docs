When a user signs up for Camunda 8 as the first user from their organization, company, or group, they become the owner of the Camunda organization. This organization owns Modeler files and Zeebe clusters. The owner and any admins they assign can control access to these resources through managing their organization.

## Users

An owner has all rights in an organization and can manage all settings accordingly. An organization cannot have more than one owner.

To change the owner of the organization, utilize the user administration. The current owner selects another member of the organization, and selects **Assign as owner** from the menu. In the dialog that appears, select which new roles are to be assigned to the current owner.

### Roles and permissions

In addition to the owner, the **Admin** role is available as a second role with comprehensive rights.

The admin role has the same rights as the owner, but an admin cannot manage other admins.

The following roles are additionally available, providing dedicated rights for specific elements in Camunda 8:

- **Operations Engineer**: Full access to Console, except deletion privileges. Full access to Operate and Web Modeler, except deployment and process instance creation privileges
- **Analyst**: Full access to Optimize and Web Modeler, except deployment and process instance creation privileges. Read-only access to Clusters
- **Task User**: Full access to Tasklist and Web Modeler, except deployment and process instance creation privileges. Read-only access to Clusters
- **Developer**: Full access to Console, except deletion privileges. Full access to Operate, Tasklist, and Web Modeler
- **Visitor**: Read-only access to Console, Operate, and Tasklist. Full access to Web Modeler, except deployment and process instance creation privileges
- **Modeler**: Full access to Web Modeler, except deployment and process instance creation privileges. Read-only access to Console and clusters, except access to cluster components

Users can be assigned multiple roles. For example, a user can have the role of **Operations Engineer** and **Task User**, which gives them access to **[Operate](../../operate/operate-introduction.md)** and **[Tasklist](../../tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md)**.

Users with full access to Console can update clusters and toggle [auto-updates](/reference/auto-updates.md).

Users are invited to a Camunda 8 organization via their email address, which must be accepted by the user. The user remains in the `Pending` state until the invitation is accepted.

People who do not yet have a Camunda 8 account can also be invited to an organization. To access the organization, however, the invited individual must first create a Camunda 8 account by following the instructions in the invitation email.
