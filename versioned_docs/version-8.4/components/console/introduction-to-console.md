:::note
As of version 8.4, Console is only available in Camunda 8 SaaS. For Self-Managed content, visit our [Self-Managed documentation](/self-managed/about-self-managed.md).
:::

Camunda Console is the management application for the included products, such as Modeler, Tasklist, Operate, and Optimize.

Using Camunda Console, you can:

- [Create](./manage-clusters/create-cluster.md) and [delete](./manage-clusters/delete-cluster.md) clusters.
- [Manage API clients](./manage-clusters/manage-api-clients.md) to interact with [Zeebe](/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) and [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md).
- [Manage alerts](./manage-clusters/manage-alerts.md) to get notified when workflow errors occur.
- [Manage IP allowlists](./manage-clusters/manage-ip-allowlists.md) to restrict access to clusters.
- [Manage](./manage-organization/organization-settings.md) your organization.
- Use [Administration API clients (REST)](apis-tools/administration-api/administration-api-reference.md) to manage clusters programmatically.

If you don't have a Camunda 8 account yet, visit our [getting started guide](../../guides/create-account.md).
