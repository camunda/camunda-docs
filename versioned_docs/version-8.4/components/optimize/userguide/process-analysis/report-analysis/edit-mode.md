Edit mode allows you to configure the report and adjust it to your needs. The following operations are possible within edit mode:

- Rename your report
- Add/edit/remove description
- Build a report
- Configure your report
- Save the current state with your applied changes
- Cancel changes you already applied to the report

Building a report is the crux of the report edit mode. The building process itself is composed of several steps, which happen in the control panel.

:::note
In edit mode, you can toggle the automatic preview update of the report by toggling the **Update Preview Automatically** switch. You can also use the **Run** button to run the update manually.
By default, the automatic preview update is **disabled**.
The toggle setting is stored in the user session and will be applied as a default value next time.
