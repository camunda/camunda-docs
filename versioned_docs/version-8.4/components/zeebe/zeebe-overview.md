Zeebe is the workflow engine powering Camunda 8. While written in Java, you do not need to be a Java developer to use Zeebe.

With Zeebe you can:

- Define processes graphically in [BPMN 2.0](../modeler/bpmn/bpmn-coverage.md).
- Choose any [gRPC](/apis-tools/zeebe-api/grpc.md)-supported programming language to implement your workers.
- Build processes that react to events from Apache Kafka and other messaging platforms.
- Use as part of a software as a service (SaaS) offering with Camunda 8 or deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises) with Camunda 8 Self-Managed.
- Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput.
- Rely on fault tolerance and high availability for your processes.
- Export processes data for monitoring and analysis (currently only available through the [Elasticsearch exporter](../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md) added in Camunda 8 Self-Managed).
- Engage with an active community.

For documentation on deploying Zeebe as part of Camunda 8 Self-Managed, refer to the [deployment guide](../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/zeebe-installation.md).

## Next steps

- Get familiar with [technical concepts](technical-concepts/technical-concepts-overview.md).
