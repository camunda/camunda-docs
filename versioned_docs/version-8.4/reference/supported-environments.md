description: "Find out where to run Camunda 8 components for SaaS and Self-Managed, including Optimize for both Camunda 8 and Camunda 7."
---

The supported environments page lists browsers, operating systems, clients, deployment options, and component requirements, which are tested and supported for compatibility with Camunda 8.

**If the particular technology is not listed, we cannot resolve issues caused by the usage of that unlisted technology.**

You may [raise a feature request](/reference/contact.md) that will be evaluated by our product teams to provide official support from Camunda, or you can make a [help request](/reference/contact.md) to work with Consulting services.

Recommendations are denoted with [recommended], however, other options are supported as well.

:::note Minimum versions
The versions listed on this page are the minimum version required if appended with a `+`.

Pay attention to where the `+` falls, as most of our dependencies follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver), where `x.y.z` correspond to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Higher or more recent versions will be compatible with Camunda, with respect to semver.

For example, 1.2+ means support for the minor version 2, and any higher minors (1.3, 1.4, etc.) and patches (1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc.), but not majors, like 2.x.

## Camunda 8 Self-Managed

We recommend running Camunda 8 Self-Managed in a Kubernetes environment. We provide officially supported [Helm Charts](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/overview.md) for this. Please follow the [Installation Guide](/self-managed/platform-deployment/overview.md) to learn more about installation possibilities.

### Deployment options

With the right configuration, Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed on any [Certified Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/#benefits) distribution (cloud or on-premises). However, we officially test and support a specific list of platforms.

The following are tested and supported deployment options for Kubernetes, Docker, and manual installation:

- [Stock Kubernetes](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/overview.md)
- [Cloud service providers](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/platforms.md) [recommended]
  - [Amazon EKS](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/amazon-eks/amazon-eks.md)
  - [Microsoft AKS](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/microsoft-aks.md)
  - [Google GKE](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/google-gke.md)
- [Red Hat OpenShift](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/redhat-openshift.md) (4.11+)
- [Docker](/self-managed/platform-deployment/docker.md)
- [Manual](/self-managed/platform-deployment/manual.md)

:::note Helm chart compatibility
Ensure the Camunda component versions are compatible with the Helm chart version as defined in the [matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).

### Sizing

The [sizing of a Camunda 8 installation](/components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md) depends on various influencing factors. Ensure to [determine these factors](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#understanding-influencing-factors), and conduct [benchmarking](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#running-experiments-and-benchmarks) to validate an appropriate environment size for your test, integration, or production environments.

#### Volume performance

As a minimum requirement, the persistent volumes for Zeebe should use volumes with an absolute minimum of 1,000 IOPS. **NFS or other types of network storage volumes are not supported.**

To ensure an appropriate sizing, [determine your influencing factors](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#understanding-influencing-factors) (e.g., throughput), and conduct [benchmarking to validate an appropriate environment sizing](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#running-experiments-and-benchmarks).

For details on typical volume type usage, refer to the following examples specific to cloud service providers:

- [Amazon EKS](../self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/amazon-eks/amazon-eks.md#volume-performance)
- [Microsoft AKS](../self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/microsoft-aks.md#volume-performance)
- [Google GKE](../self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/platforms/google-gke.md#volume-performance)
