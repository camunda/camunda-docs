## About cluster capacity

Cluster capacity provides a high-level overview of how well a cluster is coping with its current workload.

- Use this information to check and monitor if a cluster is appropriately sized for its workload.
- Cluster capacity can also be used as an indicator of cluster health. For example, a cluster running at maximum capacity can be an indicator of poor cluster responsiveness.

A general guideline to follow when using cluster capacity percentage as a metric is:

- **High capacity percentage**: The higher the capacity percentage value, the more likely it is that things will slow down, time out, requests will fail, and so on.
- **Low capacity percentage**: The lower the capacity percentage value, the more you could increase the cluster workload as the cluster is probably underused.

For example, if a cluster is continually running at 95%, this means it is probably overloaded and may not be performing well, but if the cluster capacity is only 5% then it can probably accept more workload and may be underused.

## View cluster capacity

If your cluster supports capacity monitoring, the percentage is shown in the **Capacity** column on the Console **Clusters** tab.

<img src={CapacityPercentImg} alt="Example cluster capacity percentage" />

Select a cluster to view detailed cluster capacity information on the cluster **Overview** tab.

<img src={CapacityImg} alt="Example cluster capacity" style={{width: '550px'}}/>

- The current cluster capacity is shown as a percentage bar at the top of the section.
- The chart shows detailed capacity data for the last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.
  - Select the time period you want to view data for.
  - Hover over individual nodes in the chart to view data for a specific time or day.
- Click the **Refresh** icon to refresh and update the cluster capacity data.

## Manage cluster capacity

Cluster capacity will fluctuate based on incoming user requests, and internal processing load.

- User requests are those sent directly by an external client.
- Internal load refers to all other processing that is **not** directly triggered by a client. For example, timer events, a job being made available after back off, and so on.

This means that cluster capacity could fluctuate throughout the day. For example:

- Capacity might be higher during business hours, but lower overnight when the cluster is unused.
- Certain processes can cause a "fan-out" effect, where even though creating a process instance is only a single user request, it could require computation on a very large multi-instance collection, resulting in a high capacity spike.
- You could have a spike in capacity if a large number of timers are triggered at the same time.

### High capacity percentage

A high capacity percentage/utilization does not necessarily mean that a cluster needs to be resized, but it could indicate that your cluster is overloaded.

> A high capacity percentage benchmark is relative, but generally **anything above 60%** is considered high.

If your cluster utilization is too high, but your operations are completing within an acceptable timeframe, requests are successful, and so on, then you do not need to take any action.

However, if you find yourself experiencing any of the following, then you might need to investigate and take action:

- REST clients are receiving a high number of `429` errors.
- gRPC clients are receiving a high number of `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors.
- More and more commands or queries are timing out in your clients.
- Web components are slowing down, or showing data that is severely out of date (for example, 1 hour).

In this scenario, you should look at reducing the overall load on the cluster.

### Reduce cluster utilization

If your cluster utilization is too high, you can help reduce it by:

- Scaling down the load. For example, by stopping certain clients. Start with your least critical load, and continue from there.
- Check your running process instances for known issues that cause high processing, such as:
  - Straight-through processing loops, where there are no wait states. For example, a sub process with an error boundary event which loops back to an activity leading into the sub-process. If you have an activity which consistently throws an error, this will result in a subtle infinite loop where the engine is stuck and cannot process anything else. You would have to cancel this instance, or contact support to force cancel it for you.

:::important
If your cluster capacity percentage remains high even after attempts to reduce it, you might need to increase your cluster size and scale. See [cluster size](/components/concepts/clusters.md#cluster-size) and [sizing your environment](/components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md).

## How cluster capacity percentage is calculated {#capacity-calculation}

Cluster capacity percentage is based on the cluster's [flow control configuration](/self-managed/operational-guides/configure-flow-control/configure-flow-control.md).

Essentially, if flow control is configured, every partition is assigned a [write rate](/self-managed/operational-guides/configure-flow-control/configure-flow-control.md#exporting-and-write-rate) and a [write rate limit](/self-managed/operational-guides/configure-flow-control/configure-flow-control.md#write-rate-limit).

This means a partition's cluster capacity is defined as:

`(writeRate / writeRateLimit)`

This gives a value between 0 and 1, which is multiplied by 100 to give the partition capacity as a percentage.

The cluster capacity percentage is then the average of the capacity of all partitions in the cluster.

:::note
The partition capacity is _only_ calculated and reported on the current partition leader.
