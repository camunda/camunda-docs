Console environment variables could be set in Helm via the `console.env` key. For more details, check [Console Helm values](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/camunda/camunda-platform#console-parameters).

:::note
Camunda 8 components without a valid license may display **Non-Production License** in the navigation bar and issue warnings in the logs. These warnings have no impact on Console startup or functionality. To obtain a license, visit the [Camunda Enterprise page](https://camunda.com/platform/camunda-platform-enterprise-contact/).

### Proxy

These settings are useful when the application needs to make outgoing network requests in environments that require traffic to pass through a proxy server.

| Environment variable | Description                                                                                    | Example value                         | Default value |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `http_proxy`         | Specifies the proxy server to be used for outgoing HTTP requests.                              | `http://proxy.example.com:8080`       | -             |
| `https_proxy`        | Specifies the proxy server to be used for outgoing HTTPS requests.                             | `https://secureproxy.example.com:443` | -             |
| `no_proxy`           | A comma-separated list of domain names or IP addresses for which the proxy should be bypassed. | `localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com`    | -             |

:::note
The proxy-related environment variables are lowercase because they follow a widely accepted convention used in many system environments and tools.

## Telemetry

You can enable telemetry and usage collection to help us improve our product by sending several telemetry metrics to Camunda. The information we collect will contribute to continuous product enhancement and help us understand how Camunda is used. We do not collect sensitive information and limit data points to several metrics. For more information, you can download collected data set metrics from the telemetry page at anytime.

By enabling data collection and reporting, you can get a new page to introspect Camunda 8 component metrics. Usually accessible via monitoring tools like Prometheus, you can now access these metrics directly in Console. By default, telemetry collection is disabled and no data is collected.
When `CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_TELEMETRY` env var or `telemetry` parameter is set to `online`, the telemetry feature is activated and the collected data is sent once every 24 hours via HTTPS.
When `CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_TELEMETRY` env var or `telemetry` parameter is set to `download`, the telemetry feature is activated. Data collected **will not** be sent to Camuda automatically, but could be downloaded from Console and shared with us on request.

To enable usage collection, configure the parameters described in the next section.

## Configuration parameters

To enable telemetry, the following parameters need to be configured. Camunda will provide you with the customer ID (Camunda Docker username) needed to send telemetry data to Camunda.

| Parameter        | Description                                                                         | Example value   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `customerId`     | Unique identifier of the customer. This is also a Camunda Docker registry user name | `customername`  |
| `installationId` | Unique installation ID of the current customer installation                         | `my-deployment` |
| `telemetry`      | Telemetry config for Console Self-Managed: `disabled`, `online` or `download`       | `online`        |

Console environment variables could be set in Helm. For more details, check [Console Helm values](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/camunda/camunda-platform#console-parameters).
For example:

```yaml
console:
  env:
    - name: CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_CUSTOMERID
      values: customername
    - name: CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_INSTALLATIONID
      values: my-deployment
    - name: CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_TELEMETRY
      value: online
```

## Using a different OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication provider than Keycloak

By default, Console uses Keycloak to provide authentication.
You can use a different OIDC provider by following the steps described in the [OIDC connection guide](/self-managed/setup/guides/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md).

## Monitoring

To help understand how Console operates, we expose the following endpoints by default:

| Endpoint                                         | Port   | Path                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| Metrics endpoint with default Prometheus metrics | `9100` | `/prometheus`       |
| Readiness probe                                  | `9100` | `/health/readiness` |
| Liveness probe                                   | `9100` | `/health/liveness`  |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Solution                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid parameter: redirect_uri          | Ensure the correct redirect URL is configured for the application Console in Identity. The redirect URL must match the Console URL.               |
| JWKS for authentication is not reachable | To verify a user's access token the JWKS needs to be reachable. Make sure the environment variable `KEYCLOAK_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` is set correctly. |
| Console shows error 401                  | Make sure the logged-in user has the role `Console` assigned in the Identity service.                                                             |
