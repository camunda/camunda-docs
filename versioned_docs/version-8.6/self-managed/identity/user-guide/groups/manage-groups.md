Groups are a way to apply a set of [roles](/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/manage-roles.md) and authorizations to [users](/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/manage-roles.md).

To create a group, take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Groups** tab:

3. Fill in the name of the group and click **Add**:

On confirmation, the modal closes, the table updates, and your new group is shown:
