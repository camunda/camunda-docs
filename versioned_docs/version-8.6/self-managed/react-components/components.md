All components except Web Modeler and Console are single Java applications. Depending on your needs, you might not need all of the above components to successfully use Camunda 8.

Camunda 8 Self-Managed users may also use [Desktop Modeler](../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md) as an addition to these components. Desktop Modeler can be used by process developers to build BPMN diagrams, DMN diagrams, or [Camunda Forms](../../guides/utilizing-forms.md) for automation.
