---

The supported environments page lists browsers, operating systems, clients, deployment options, and component requirements, which are tested and supported for compatibility with Camunda 8.

**If the particular technology is not listed, we cannot resolve issues caused by the usage of that unlisted technology.**

You may [raise a feature request](/reference/contact.md) that will be evaluated by our product teams to provide official support from Camunda, or you can make a [help request](/reference/contact.md) to work with Consulting services.

Recommendations are denoted with [recommended], however, other listed options are supported as well.

:::note Minimum versions
The versions listed on this page are the minimum version required if appended with a `+`.

Pay attention to where the `+` falls, as most of our dependencies follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver), where `x.y.z` correspond to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Higher or more recent versions will be compatible with Camunda, with respect to semver.

For example, 1.2+ means support for the minor version 2, and any higher minors (1.3, 1.4, etc.) and patches (1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc.), but not majors, like 2.x.

:::

## Camunda 8 Self-Managed

We recommend running Camunda 8 Self-Managed in a Kubernetes environment. We provide officially supported [Helm Charts](/self-managed/setup/overview.md) for this. Please follow the [Installation Guide](/self-managed/setup/overview.md) to learn more about installation possibilities.

### Deployment options

With the right configuration, Camunda 8 Self-Managed can be deployed on any [Certified Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/#benefits) distribution (cloud or on-premises). However, we officially test and support a specific list of platforms.

The following are tested and supported deployment options for Kubernetes, Docker, and manual installation:

- [Stock Kubernetes](/self-managed/setup/install.md)
- [Cloud service providers](/self-managed/setup/install.md) [recommended]
  - [Amazon EKS](/self-managed/setup/deploy/amazon/amazon-eks/amazon-eks.md)
  - [Microsoft AKS](/self-managed/setup/deploy/azure/microsoft-aks.md)
  - [Google GKE](/self-managed/setup/deploy/gcp/google-gke.md)
- [Red Hat OpenShift](/self-managed/setup/deploy/openshift/redhat-openshift.md)
- [Docker](/self-managed/setup/deploy/other/docker.md) (`linux/amd64`)
- [Manual](/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/manual.md)

:::note Helm chart compatibility
Ensure the Camunda component versions are compatible with the Helm chart version as defined in the [matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).
:::

### Sizing

The [sizing of a Camunda 8 installation](/components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md) depends on various influencing factors. Ensure to [determine these factors](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#understanding-influencing-factors), and conduct [benchmarking](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#running-experiments-and-benchmarks) to validate an appropriate environment size for your test, integration, or production environments.

#### Volume performance

As a minimum requirement, the persistent volumes for Zeebe should use volumes with an absolute minimum of 1,000 IOPS. **NFS or other types of network storage volumes are not supported.**

To ensure an appropriate sizing, [determine your influencing factors](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#understanding-influencing-factors) (e.g., throughput), and conduct [benchmarking to validate an appropriate environment sizing](../components/best-practices/architecture/sizing-your-environment.md#running-experiments-and-benchmarks).

For details on typical volume type usage, refer to the following examples specific to cloud service providers:

- [Amazon EKS](/self-managed/setup/deploy/amazon/amazon-eks/amazon-eks.md#volume-performance)
- [Microsoft AKS](/self-managed/setup/deploy/azure/microsoft-aks.md#volume-performance)
- [Google GKE](/self-managed/setup/deploy/gcp/google-gke.md#volume-performance)

### Helm version matrix

As of the Camunda 8.4 release, the Camunda 8 Helm chart version is independent from the application version (for example, the Camunda 8.4 release uses the Helm chart version 9.0.0). The Helm chart is updated with each application release.

| Camunda version | Helm chart version                                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Camunda 8.6.x   | [Helm chart 11.x](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/camunda-8.6/)  |
| Camunda 8.5.x   | [Helm chart 10.x](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/camunda-8.5/)  |
| Camunda 8.4.x   | [Helm chart 9.x](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/camunda-8.4/)   |
| Camunda 8.3.x   | [Helm chart 8.3.x](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/camunda-8.3/) |

\*Not all Optimize features are supported when using OpenSearch as a database. For a full list of the features that are currently supported, please refer to the [Camunda 8](https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues/635) OpenSearch features.

When running Elasticsearch, you must have the [appropriate Elasticsearch privileges](/self-managed/concepts/elasticsearch-privileges.md).

When running Amazon OpenSearch 2.11 or higher, we do not support [OR1 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/or1.html)
due to the [limitation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/or1.html#or1-considerations)
for the index refresh interval. More information on configuring Amazon OpenSearch can be found [here](/self-managed/setup/guides/using-existing-opensearch.md).

:::note Elasticsearch support
Camunda 8 works with the [default distribution](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) of Elasticsearch, which is available under the [Free or Gold+ Elastic license](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing#summary).
