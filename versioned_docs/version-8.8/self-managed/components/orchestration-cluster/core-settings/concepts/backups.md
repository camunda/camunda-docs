When running an orchestration cluster with [secondary storage](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/properties.md#secondary-storage), you must configure a snapshot repository in your chosen database:

- [Elasticsearch snapshot repository](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore.html)
- [OpenSearch snapshot repository](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/snapshot-restore/)

The Orchestration Cluster is configured with the snapshot repository name to trigger database snapshots. This ensures coherent backups.

Learn more about the backup procedure and why it must be triggered in the [backup guide](/self-managed/operational-guides/backup-restore/backup-and-restore.md).
