title: Configuration
---

As a Spring Boot application, Operate supports any standard
[Spring configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html) method.

By default, the configuration for Operate is stored in a YAML file (`application.yml`). All Operate-related settings are prefixed with `camunda.operate`.

:::note
Configuration properties can be defined as environment variables using [Spring Boot conventions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables). To define an environment variable, convert the configuration property to uppercase, remove any dashes, and replace any delimiters (`.`) with `_`.

For example, the property `camunda.operate.elasticsearch.clustername` is represented by the environment variable `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTERNAME`.
:::

The following parts are configurable:

## Licensing

import Licensing from '../../self-managed/react-components/licensing.md'

<Licensing/>

## Webserver

Operate supports customizing the **context-path** using default Spring configuration.

Example for `application.yml`:
`server.servlet.context-path: /operate`

Example for environment variable:
`SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXT_PATH=/operate`

The default context-path is `/`.

### Security

To change the values for http header for security reasons, you can use the configuration parameters:

| Name                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Default value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Securing Operate - Zeebe interaction

While executing user operations, Operate communicates with Zeebe using the Zeebe Java client. For Zeebe to know whether operations are allowed to be executed
in terms of tenant assignment, Operate - Zeebe connection must be secured. Check the list of environment variables to be provided in the [Zeebe documentation](../../zeebe-deployment/security/client-authorization/#environment-variables).

### Troubleshooting multi-tenancy in Operate

If users can view data from the `<default>` tenant only and no data from other tenants (and you have not [configured multi-tenancy using Helm](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/camunda/camunda-platform#global-parameters)), multi-tenancy is not enabled in Operate. Refer to the [configuration instructions above](#multi-tenancy).

If multi-tenancy is enabled in Operate but disabled in [Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md), users will not have any tenant authorizations in Operate
and will not be able to access the data of any tenants in Operate.

## Elasticsearch or OpenSearch

Operate stores and reads data from Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

Set the `camunda.operate.database` to the appropriate database.

Valid values are `elasticsearch` (default) and `opensearch`.

Example as environment variable: `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_DATABASE=opensearch`.

:::note
As of the 8.4 release, Operate is now compatible with [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/de/opensearch-service/) 2.5.x. Note that using Amazon OpenSearch requires [setting up a new Camunda installation](/self-managed/setup/overview.md). A migration from previous versions or Elasticsearch environments is currently not supported.
:::

### Settings to connect

Operate supports [basic authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/setting-up-authentication.html) for Elasticsearch and OpenSearch

Set the appropriate username/password combination in the configuration to use it.

### Settings for Elasticsearch

#### Settings to connect to a secured Elasticsearch instance

To connect to a secured (https) Elasticsearch instance, you normally need to only set the URL protocol
part to `https` instead of `http`. A secured Elasticsearch instance also needs `username` and `password`.
The other SSL settings should only be used in case of connection problems; for example, in disabling
host verification.

:::note
You may need to import the certificate into JVM runtime.
:::

Either set `host` and `port` (deprecated), or `url` (recommended).

| Name                                              | Description                               | Default value         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.indexPrefix         | Prefix for index names                    | operate               |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.clusterName         | Cluster name of Elasticsearch             | elasticsearch         |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.url                 | URL of Elasticsearch REST API             | http://localhost:9200 |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.username            | Username to access Elasticsearch REST API | -                     |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.password            | Password to access Elasticsearch REST API | -                     |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.ssl.certificatePath | Path to certificate used by Elasticsearch | -                     |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.ssl.selfSigned      | Certificate was self-signed               | false                 |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.ssl.verifyHostname  | Should the hostname be validated          | false                 |

#### Settings for shards and replicas

Operate creates the template with index settings named `operate-<version>_template` that Elasticsearch uses for all Operate indices. These settings can be changed.

The following configuration parameters define the settings:

| Name                                           | Description                                                  | Default value |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.numberOfShards   | How many shards Elasticsearch uses for all Operate indices   | 1             |
| camunda.operate.elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas | How many replicas Elasticsearch uses for all Operate indices | 0             |

These values are applied only on first startup of Operate or during version update. After the Operate
schema is created, settings may be adjusted directly in the Elasticsearch template, and the new settings are applied
to indices created after adjustment.

#### A snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  elasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Url
    url: https://localhost:9200
    ssl:
      selfSigned: true
```

#### Disable Elasticsearch deprecation logging

When using an Elasticsearch version 8.16.0+ it is recommended to turn off deprecation logging for the Elasticsearch cluster.

```shell
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "persistent": {
      "logger.org.elasticsearch.deprecation": "OFF"
    }
  }'
```

### Settings for OpenSearch

#### Settings to connect to a secured OpenSearch instance

To connect to a secured (https) OpenSearch instance, you normally need to only set the URL protocol
part to `https` instead of `http`. A secured OpenSearch instance also needs `username` and `password`.

To use AWS credentials instead of basic auth when connecting to Amazon OpenSearch Services, `awsEnabled` must be set.

The other SSL settings should only be used in case of connection problems; for example, in disabling host verification.

:::note
You may need to import the certificate into JVM runtime.
:::

Either set `host` and `port` (deprecated), or `url` (recommended).

| Name                                           | Description                            | Default value         |

| camunda.operate.opensearch.ssl.selfSigned      | Certificate was self-signed            | false                 |
| camunda.operate.opensearch.ssl.verifyHostname  | Should the hostname be validated       | false                 |
| camunda.operate.opensearch.awsEnabled          | Should AWS credentials be used         | false                 |

#### Settings for shards and replicas

Operate creates the template with index settings named `operate-<version>_template` that OpenSearch uses for all Operate indices. These settings can be changed.

The following configuration parameters define the settings:

| Name                                        | Description                                               | Default value |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| camunda.operate.opensearch.numberOfShards   | How many shards OpenSearch uses for all Operate indices   | 1             |
| camunda.operate.opensearch.numberOfReplicas | How many replicas OpenSearch uses for all Operate indices | 0             |

These values are applied only on first startup of Operate or during version update. After the Operate
schema is created, settings may be adjusted directly in the OpenSearch template, and the new settings are applied
to indices created after adjustment.

#### A snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  opensearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: opensearch
    # Url
    url: https://localhost:9200
    ssl:
      selfSigned: true
```

## Zeebe Broker connection

Operate needs a connection to the Zeebe Broker to start the import and execute user operations.

### Settings to connect

| Name                                  | Description                                                                                                        | Default value   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| camunda.operate.zeebe.gatewayAddress  | Gateway address that points to Zeebe as hostname and port.                                                         | localhost:26500 |
| camunda.operate.zeebe.secure          | Connection should be secure via Transport Layer Security (TLS).                                                    | false           |
| camunda.operate.zeebe.certificatePath | Path to certificate used by Zeebe. This is necessary when the certificate isn't registered in the operating system | -               |

Additionally, visit [Zeebe Secure Client Communication](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/security/secure-client-communication.md) for more details.

### A snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  zeebe:
    # Gateway host and port
    gatewayAddress: localhost:26500
```

## Zeebe Elasticsearch or OpenSearch exporter

:::note
Please refer to [Supported Environments](../../reference/supported-environments.md#camunda-8-self-managed) to find out which versions of Elasticsearch or OpenSearch are supported in a Camunda 8 Self-Managed setup.
:::

For Elasticsearch, Operate imports data from indices created and filled in by the [Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter](../zeebe-deployment/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md).

For OpenSearch, Operate imports data from indices created and filled in by the [Zeebe OpenSearch exporter](../zeebe-deployment/exporters/opensearch-exporter.md).

Therefore, settings for this Elasticsearch or OpenSearch connection must be defined and must correspond to the settings on the Zeebe side.

### Settings to connect and import

See also [settings to connect to a secured Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance](#settings-to-connect-to-a-secured-elasticsearch-or-opensearch-instance).

:::note
You may need to import the certificate keystore into the JVM runtime.

```yaml
# Kubernetes example:
zeebe:
  …
  javaOpts: >-
    …
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/certificates/elasticsearch.jks

## Operation executor

Operations are user operations, like cancellation of process instance(s) or updating the variable value.

Operations are executed in a multi-threaded manner.

| Name                                           | Description                      | Default value |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| camunda.operate.operationExecutor.threadsCount | How many threads should be used. | 3             |

### Snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  operationExecutor:
  	threadsCount: 3
```

## Monitoring Operate

Operate includes [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready) inside. This provides the number of monitoring possibilities.

Operate uses the following Actuator configuration by default:

```yaml
# Disable default health indicators
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-health-indicators
management.health.defaults.enabled: false
# enable Kubernetes health groups:
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-kubernetes-probes
management.health.probes.enabled: true
# enable several Actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health, prometheus, loggers, usage-metrics, backup
```

With this configuration, the following endpoints are available for use out of the box:

`<server>:9600/actuator/prometheus` Prometheus metrics

`<server>:9600/actuator/health/liveness` Liveness probe

`<server>:9600/actuator/health/readiness` Readiness probe

This configuration may be overwritten by changing the corresponding configuration parameters values.

## Logging

Operate uses the Log4j2 framework for logging. In the distribution archive, as well as inside a Docker image, `config/log4j2.xml` logging configuration files are included and can be further adjusted to your needs:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN" monitorInterval="30">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="LOG_PATTERN">%clr{%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}}{faint} %clr{%5p} %clr{${sys:PID}}{magenta} %clr{---}{faint} %clr{[%15.15t]}{faint} %clr{%-40.40c{1.}}{cyan} %clr{:}{faint} %m%n%xwEx</Property>
  </Properties>
  <Appenders>
    <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT" follow="true">
      <PatternLayout pattern="${LOG_PATTERN}"/>
    </Console>
	<Console name="Stackdriver" target="SYSTEM_OUT" follow="true">
      <StackdriverJSONLayout/>
    </Console>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Logger name="io.camunda.operate" level="info" />
    <Root level="info">
      <AppenderRef ref="${env:OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER:-Console}"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

By default, `ConsoleAppender` is used.

### JSON logging configuration

You can choose to output logs in JSON format (Stackdriver compatible). To enable it, define
the environment variable `OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER` like this:

```sh
OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER=Stackdriver
```

### Change logging level at runtime

Operate supports the default scheme for changing logging levels as provided by [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.3/actuator-api/htmlsingle/#loggers).

The log level for Operate can be changed by following the [Setting a Log Level](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.3/actuator-api/htmlsingle/#loggers-setting-level) section.
