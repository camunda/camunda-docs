### APIs

Use the Orchestration Cluster REST API to interact programmatically with the Orchestration Cluster.

- This replaces component APIs (Operate API, Tasklist API, Zeebe API, and much of Identity API) with a single set of endpoints.
- This unified API supports both organizational (SaaS) and Self-Managed deployments.
- This is now the default and recommended integration point for developers, operators, and automation solutions.
- You can also use a Swagger UI to interact with this API.

<p><a href="../../../../apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview/" class="link-arrow">Orchestration Cluster API</a></p>

### Camunda Java client

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2248 -->

The new Camunda Java Client replaces the Zeebe Java Client as the official Java library for building process applications that integrate with Camunda 8. This client provides everything you need to programmatically interact with the Orchestration Cluster, whether you are orchestrating microservices, managing human tasks, or visualizing process data.

<p><a href="../../../../apis-tools/java-client/getting-started/" class="link-arrow">Get started with the Camunda Java client</a></p>

### Camunda Process Test H2 data layer support

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2687 -->

Camunda Process Test supports using the [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) as the default embedded data layer.

- H2 is now automatically provisioned when integrating the Camunda Process Test libraries, eliminating manual database configuration and reducing memory footprint.
- H2 support streamlines the developer experience for your Spring Boot and plain Java projects. Process testing is now faster to set up, simpler to maintain, and easier to integrate with your continuous integration workflows.

<p><a href="../../../../apis-tools/testing/getting-started" class="link-arrow">Camunda Process Test</a></p>

### Camunda Spring Boot Starter

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2249 -->

The Camunda Spring Boot Starter replaces the Spring Zeebe SDK to simplify interaction between a Spring Boot application and Camunda 8, allowing you to:

- Easily integrate process entity management and queries within your workflows.
- Seamlessly configure endpoints and authentication via Spring Boot auto-configuration, minimizing boilerplate code.
- Rely on an official, standardized approach to guarantee consistency and reduce maintenance costs when upgrading.
- Based on Spring Boot 3.5 ([version compatibility matrix](/apis-tools/camunda-spring-boot-starter/getting-started.md#version-compatibility)).

<p><a href="../../../../apis-tools/camunda-spring-boot-starter/getting-started/" class="link-arrow">Get started with the Camunda Spring Boot Starter</a></p>

### Process instance tags

Introduce optional, immutable **process instance tags** set at creation for lightweight routing, correlation, and future prioritization without inspecting large variable payloads. See [process instance creation](/components/concepts/process-instance-creation.md#tags) and [job workers](/components/concepts/job-workers.md#tags).

<p><a href="../../../../components/concepts/process-instance-creation/" class="link-arrow">Process instance creation</a></p>

### Public API

Find out what’s included in Camunda 8's public API, the policies around versioning, and what to expect when upgrading.

- The public API is the official contract between Camunda and its users under SemVer.
- No breaking changes will be made to the public API in minor or patch releases.
- You can safely build on these interfaces with the expectation of stability and backward compatibility.

<p><a href="../../../../reference/public-api/" class="link-arrow">Public API</a></p>

### Run process segment

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2453 -->

Manually execute and test individual tasks or segments (connectors, RPA bots, IDP extractions) without running full processes, improving debugging and development efficiency.

<p><a href="../../../../components/concepts/process-instance-creation/#run-process-segment" class="link-arrow">Run process segment</a></p>

### Ad-hoc tools schema resolver connector

This connector implements the tool resolution part of the AI Agent connector, but can also be used independently with other AI connectors for direct LLM interaction. Use this connector if you don’t want to use the AI agent connector but still want to resolve tools for an ad-hoc sub-process or debug tool definitions.

<p><a href="../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-ad-hoc-tools-schema-resolver/" class="link-arrow">Ad-hoc tools schema resolver connector</a></p>

### AI Agent connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2779 -->

Enable AI agents to integrate with an LLM to provide interaction/reasoning capabilities. Designed for use with an [ad-hoc sub-process](/components/modeler/bpmn/ad-hoc-subprocesses/ad-hoc-subprocesses.md) in a [feedback loop](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent-subprocess-example.md), providing automated user interaction and tool selection.

<p><a href="../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent/" class="link-arrow">AI Agent connector</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../../components/early-access/alpha/mcp-client/" class="link-arrow">MCP client connector</a></p>

### Vector database connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2744 -->
<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2779 -->

Enable embedding, storing, and retrieving Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings. Use to build AI-based solutions for your organizations, such as context document search, long-term LLM memory, and agentic AI interaction in combination with the AI Agent connector (RAG).

<p><a href="../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/embeddings-vector-db" class="link-arrow">Vector database connector</a></p>

### Email connector `Message-ID`

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/connectors/pull/4657 -->

The Email connector now exposes the `Message-ID` provided by the client in the connector response payload. This allows for improved traceability, easier correlation between sent messages and logs, and better integration with downstream systems that rely on `Message-ID`.

:::note
This change is backwards-compatible and does not require any action. You can now optionally use the `messageId` field for enhanced tracking when parsing connector responses.
:::

### Intrinsic functions

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/5934 -->

A new `getJson` intrinsic function accepts a document and an optional FEEL expression. It extracts and returns content from a JSON document as an object.

- The optional FEEL expression parameter specifies the part that will be extracted from the JSON document content.
- If not provided, the whole document is returned as a JSON object.

<p><a href="../../../../components/connectors/use-connectors/intrinsic-functions" class="link-arrow">Intrinsic functions</a></p>

### Job header binding

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/5131 -->

Use the `@Header` annotation to bind a header value (for example, a FEEL expression) to a model class.

### SQL connector Oracle database connection

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/5074 -->

The SQL connector now supports Oracle Database connections.

<p><a href="../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/sql" class="link-arrow">SQL connector</a></p>

## Console

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Connector manage and run supports multiple runtimes

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2750 -->
<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1933 -->

Connector manage and run in Console now supports management of multiple connector runtime instances.

<p><a href="../../../../components/console/manage-clusters/cluster-connectors" class="link-arrow">Manage your connectors</a></p>

### Docker distribution

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2242 -->

Console is now available as a Self-Managed Docker distribution. Deploy Camunda Console using a Docker image, run Console outside Kubernetes using Docker Compose or other container services, and use Console with Camunda 8 clusters deployed via Docker.

<p><a href="../../../../self-managed/quickstart/developer-quickstart/docker-compose" class="link-arrow">Docker Compose developer quickstart</a></p>

### Encryption (BYOK)

The new Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) approach with Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) allows you to configure Camunda 8 SaaS to use a customer-managed key stored in your own Amazon account. This ensures you retain ownership, control, and visibility throughout the key lifecycle, including creation, rotation, and audit logging.

- Camunda 8 SaaS encrypts all cluster data at rest to protect customer workloads. By default, encryption is managed using cloud provider–supplied keys. While this satisfies many organizations, some (especially in regulated industries) require full control over their encryption keys.
- This feature is currently available only for customers provisioning their Camunda 8 SaaS clusters in AWS regions. Support for additional cloud providers may be added in the future.

### Regions

New regions are available for SaaS clusters on Amazon Web Services:

| Type                     | Region                              |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| AWS region               | Singapore (ap-southeast-1)          |
| Secondary backups region | Ireland, Europe (eu-west-1)         |
| Secondary backups region | Jakarta, Indonesia (ap-southeast-3) |
| Secondary backups region | Oregon, North America (us-west-2)   |

Use these regions to:

- Improve overall processing speed and reduce latency if you operate in countries within that region.
- Keep cluster data within that country/region to support your local data residency and compliance needs.

<p><a href="../../../../components/saas/regions" class="link-arrow">Regions</a></p>

### Usage metrics for licence model and tenant

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1979 -->

Usage metrics now support per-tenant reporting and align with Camunda’s updated licensing model based on the number of tenants.

## Desktop Modeler

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Desktop Modeler">Desktop Modeler</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Settings

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2491 -->

The new **Settings** window in Desktop Modeler allows you to configure the application and customize your modeling experience. You can select your default execution platform version, as well as other options that were previously only available as flags.

<p><a href="../../../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/settings/" class="link-arrow">Desktop Modeler settings</a></p>

## Helm chart deployment

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Helm charts">Helm charts</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Alternative container images

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2826 -->

Camunda provides alternative container images to the previous Bitnami images, offering better security and faster patch delivery. From 8.8, these are the default supported images.

- These images are hosted on `registry.camunda.cloud`.
- To use them, update your Helm deployment to reference the `values-images-ee.yml` file.

<p><a href="../../../../self-managed/deployment/helm/install" class="link-arrow">Install Camunda with Helm</a></p>

### Configurable volumes

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2597 -->

The Helm chart now supports configurable volumes. You can define `PersistentVolumeClaims` or continue using `EmptyDir` through `values.yaml`.

### ExtraVolumeClaimTemplates

You can now add custom `extraVolumeClaimTemplates` to the Zeebe/Core StatefulSet by supplying an array of templates in your Helm values file. This allows you to attach additional persistent volumes to each Zeebe/Core pod for use cases such as custom storage or log directories.

:::info important
Kubernetes does not allow you to change the `volumeClaimTemplates` of an existing StatefulSet. If you add, remove, or modify `extraVolumeClaimTemplates` after initial deployment, you must delete and recreate the StatefulSet (which will also delete the pods) for the changes to take effect. This may require additional planning and data migration steps to avoid data loss.
:::

### Common labels for Camunda resources

A new `commonLabels` value is now available and integrates with `camundaPlatform.labels`. This allows you to define mutable labels that are automatically applied to all Camunda resources. By setting `commonLabels`, you can ensure consistent labeling across deployments, making it easier to manage, organize, and identify resources within your Camunda environment.

### Configure Web Modeler replicas

The number of replicas for the Web Modeler REST API and web app deployments can be set with new configuration properties: `webModeler.restapi.replicas` and `webModeler.webapp.replicas`, respectively.

## Integrations

### Microsoft Teams

The new Camunda for Microsoft Teams app allows you to view, claim, and complete Camunda tasks directly in Microsoft Teams.

The app integration allows you to:

- Start processes from a channel, chat, or the app **Home** tab.
- Fill out start forms in Microsoft Teams and submit them to kick off workflows, with optional links to Operate for monitoring.

<p><a href="../../../../components/early-access/alpha/ms-teams/" class="link-arrow">Camunda for Microsoft Teams app</a></p>

:::note
The Microsoft Teams integration is released as an [early access](/components/early-access/overview.md) alpha feature to allow you to test and participate in development by sharing feedback before general availability, and is subject to alpha feature limitations.
:::

### SAP Advanced Event Mesh (AEM) connectivity

Connect Camunda directly to SAP Advanced Event Mesh (AEM) for event-driven process automation.

- New AEM connectors allow you to receive CloudEvents from SAP systems as BPMN messages and publish CloudEvents from Camunda to AEM.
- This enables seamless integration with SAP’s event-driven architecture, allowing your Camunda processes to react in real time to business events across SAP BTP, S/4HANA, or ECC.

<p><a href="../../../../components/camunda-integrations/sap/eventing" class="link-arrow">SAP Eventing with SAP Advanced Event Mesh</a></p>

### ServiceNow

Extend the power of your process automation by integrating Camunda with ServiceNow. This integration enables seamless communication between your BPMN workflows and ServiceNow IT Service Management (ITSM), helping you automate routine tasks and accelerate service delivery.

The ServiceNow integration allows you to:

- Manage ServiceNow data: Create, read, update, and delete records in any ServiceNow table directly from Camunda workflows.
- Trigger ServiceNow flows: Start automations built in ServiceNow's Flow Designer as part of an end-to-end process.
- Orchestrate ITSM processes: Integrate Camunda tasks with ServiceNow approvals, incidents, and service requests to create unified workflows.

<p><a href="../../../../components/camunda-integrations/servicenow/servicenow-integration/" class="link-arrow">ServiceNow integration</a></p>

## Intelligent document processing (IDP)

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects IDP">IDP</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span></div>

### Bring your own model (BYOM)

When using an OpenAI Compatible provider, you can use your own model for document extraction. Any model provider that implements the `/chat/completions` API endpoint is supported.

Supported providers are:

- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services with Bedrock and Textract (supports both structured and unstructured extraction).
- **Azure**: Microsoft Azure with AI Document Intelligence and AI Foundry (unstructured extraction only).
- **GCP**: Google Cloud Platform with Vertex AI and Document AI (supports both structured and unstructured extraction).
- **OpenAI compatible**: Supports OpenAI and any provider implementing the OpenAI `/chat/completions` API (unstructured extraction only).

<p><a href="../../../../components/modeler/web-modeler/idp/idp-document-extraction/" class="link-arrow">Document extraction</a></p>

### Structured data form extraction

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2694 -->

You can use form-based structured document extraction to capture data from structured documents.

- For example, you can use this extraction method for documents with a consistent layout, such as invoices, tax forms (for example, W-2s, VAT declarations), and loan or insurance applications.
- Projects can be shared organization-wide, enhancing accessibility to extraction capabilities.

## Migration from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects DCamunda 7 migration">Camunda 7 migration</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Data migration tool

Use the Data Migrator to copy running process instances from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8.

- Copy running process instances (state-preserving).
- Copy process variables and their values.
- Handle problematic instances gracefully with retry options.
- Write custom code to intercept variable migration.

<p><a href="../../../../guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/data-migrator" class="link-arrow">Data Migrator</a></p>

### Migration Analyzer & Diagram Converter

The Migration Analyzer & Diagram Converter helps you get a first understanding of migration tasks when moving from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8. It analyzes Camunda 7 model files (BPMN or DMN) and generates a list of tasks required for the migration.

It can also automatically convert these files from Camunda 7 format to Camunda 8 format (updating namespaces, XML structures/properties, and simple expression transforms), with a web UI and CLI that outputs XLSX/CSV reports, for prioritization and batch conversion.

<p><a href="../../../../guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/migration-tooling#migration-analyzer--diagram-converter" class="link-arrow">Migration Analyzer & Diagram Converter</a></p>

### Code conversion

Code conversion utilities provide code mapping tables, conversion patterns, and automatable refactoring recipes to systematically translate Camunda 7 implementation patterns to Camunda 8 equivalents.

<p><a href="../../../../guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/code-conversion" class="link-arrow">Code conversion</a></p>

## Optimize

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Optimize">Optimize</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Amazon OpenSearch support

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2473 -->

Camunda 8 Self-Managed now fully supports the use of Amazon OpenSearch with Optimize.

## Orchestration Cluster

<div class="release"><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Orchestration Cluster">Orchestration Cluster</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Operate">Operate</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Tasklist">Tasklist</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Identity">Identity</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span></div>

### Architecture

The primary architectural change in 8.8 is the consolidation of the core Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Identity components into the Orchestration Cluster application as a single deployable artifact, distributed as a JAR file or Docker container.

This impacts how Camunda 8 is deployed, managed, and scaled.

- The Orchestration Cluster (previously automation cluster) is now the core component of Camunda 8.
- Use the Orchestration Cluster REST API to interact programmatically with the Orchestration Cluster.
- The new unified exporter architecture improves cluster management and data migration, bringing importer and archiving logic of web components (Tasklist and Operate) closer to the distributed platform (Zeebe). The index schema is also harmonized.
- The unified configuration for Orchestration Cluster components allows you to define cluster and component behavior.

<p><a href="../../../../reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88/#orchestration-cluster" class="link-arrow">What's new in Camunda 8.8</a></p>

### Dynamic activation of ad-hoc sub-processes using job workers

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2631 -->

Ad-hoc sub-process elements can be activated by job workers:

- Define a task in the process model.
- When the engine reaches the ad-hoc sub-process, a job is created. Completing this job with a job result lets you define which elements in the ad-hoc sub-process to activate.
- Once any flows in the ad-hoc sub-process complete, a new job is created, giving job workers control over what to do next.

### Dynamic partition scaling

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2226 -->

You can now add new Zeebe partitions to a running cluster to increase capacity without downtime:

- New process instances will be started on new partitions immediately.
- Existing process instances do not migrate between partitions, so it can take time for the cluster to reach equilibrium.
- Existing messages remain on original partitions, potentially causing slight imbalances for message-heavy workloads (future updates will address this)

<p><a href="../../../../self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/operations/cluster-scaling" class="link-arrow">Cluster scaling</a></p>

### Identity and Management Identity

In Camunda 8.8, Orchestration Cluster Identity and Management Identity are two separate components used for Identity management, each with distinct areas of responsibility.

- **Identity**: Access and permission management for all Orchestration Cluster components: Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and the Orchestration Cluster REST and gRPC API.
- **Management Identity**: Continues to manage access for platform components such as Web Modeler, Console, and Optimize.

<p><a href="../../../../reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88/#orchestration-cluster" class="link-arrow">What's new in Camunda 8.8</a></p>

### Migrate taken sequence flows flowing to the joining gateway

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2913 -->

Enhanced migration now supports taken sequence flows leading to joining gateways:

- Define migration plans mapping active elements and taken sequence flows
- Configure plans via Operate UI or API

### Process instance migration

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1314 -->

Enhanced process instance migration allows you to solve problems with process definitions and use the latest process improvements. You can now migrate compensation boundary event subscriptions, escalation boundary events, and escalation event subprocesses.

<p><a href="../../../../components/concepts/process-instance-migration/" class="link-arrow">Process instance migration</a></p>

### React to expired messages with a custom exporter

You can now use a custom exporter to react to expired messages.

- The original message is retrieved from primary storage upon expiration, and the expiry event enhanced with the original message.
- Existing functionality remains unchanged, so there is no disruption for current customers or custom exporters.

With these updates, developers can subscribe to the expired messages through a custom exporter, examine the event content, and optionally re-publish or handle the message differently.

### Run Orchestration Cluster without secondary storage

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2897 -->

You can now run Orchestration Cluster in "Zeebe-only" mode without secondary storage:

- Ideal for setups not using Query APIs, Operate, or Tasklist
- Enable by setting `camunda.database.type=none`
- Starts only the required Zeebe components

### User task listeners

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2126 -->

Task lifecycle management is enhanced with user task listeners, allowing users to react to specific user task lifecycle events.

- Process designers can now model task listeners for different events, such as `assigning` and `completing`.
- Developers can use the same job infrastructure to activate and complete task listener jobs.
- Operations engineers can easily check details of active and completed task listeners within instances, and efficiently resolve task listener incidents.

This enhancement streamlines operations and ensures smoother incident handling, improving time to unblock process execution.

<p><a href="../../../../components/concepts/user-task-listeners/" class="link-arrow">User task listeners</a></p>

### Zeebe-managed resilient batch operations

All batch operations, such as canceling or resolving incidents in bulk, are now handled by Zeebe instead of Operate.

- This change ensures region failovers in the multi-region setup no longer risk losing critical batch commands.
- Users will initiate and manage batch operations through the Orchestration Cluster REST API and the Operate UI, but the underlying processing occurs within Zeebe.
- By moving batch operations to the core engine, multi-region deployments gain reliability and resilience.

### Ad-hoc sub-process dynamic activation using job workers <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Agentic orchestration</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2631 -->

Ad-hoc sub-process elements can now be activated by job workers:

- Define a task in the process model.
- When the engine reaches the ad-hoc sub-process, a job is created. Completing this job with a job result lets you define which elements in the ad-hoc sub-process to activate.
- Once any flows in the ad-hoc sub-process complete, a new job is created, giving job workers control over what to do next.

:::note
The job result also supports fulfilling the completion condition for the ad-hoc sub-process. When this condition is met, the sub-process waits for active children to complete before finishing, unless you explicitly cancel remaining instances in the job result.
:::

### Bitbucket sync <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Web Modeler">Web Modeler</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2507 -->

Camunda 8 now supports integration with [Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/product/), in addition to GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.

- This helps customers who use Jira for their development processes.
- Organization owners and administrators can connect their Web Modeler process applications to Bitbucket Cloud, allowing users to keep their Web Modeler, Desktop Modeler, and official version control projects synced.

To learn more, see [Git sync](/components/modeler/web-modeler/git-sync.md?platform=bitbucket).

### Camunda 8 REST API renamed to Orchestration Cluster REST API <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects APIs">API</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2793 -->

The Camunda 8 REST API is now called the **Orchestration Cluster REST API**.

- This name better reflects its role as a unified REST API for interacting with entities in a [Camunda 8 Orchestration Cluster](/reference/glossary.md#orchestration-cluster), such as processes, tasks, and variables.
- The functionality and structure of the API remain unchanged. The name change improves clarity and onboarding across Camunda documentation and resources.

To learn more, see [Orchestration Cluster REST API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md).

### Connectors <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Connectors">Connectors</span> {#connectorsalpha6}

#### AI Agent connector

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/5942 -->
<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/6068 -->

- **Structured outputs/JSON mode**: [Configurable response formats](../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent-task.md#response) allow you to choose whether the connector returns plain text or JSON for downstream processing. For some models, you can define a JSON schema for returned data.
- **Conversation history storage**: History can now be stored in [Camunda's document storage](../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent.md#memory) rather than in process variables—allowing longer histories without process variable size limits.

To learn more, see [AI Agent connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent.md).

#### Intrinsic functions

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/5934 -->

A new `getJson` intrinsic function accepts a document and an optional FEEL expression. It extracts and returns content from a JSON document as an object.

- The optional FEEL expression parameter specifies the part that will be extracted from the JSON document content.
- If not provided, the whole document is returned as a JSON object.

To learn more, see [intrinsic functions](/components/connectors/use-connectors/intrinsic-functions.md).

### Dynamic partition scaling <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2226 -->

You can now add new Zeebe partitions to a running cluster.

- Scaling can be performed concurrently when the cluster is running, with zero downtime.
- New process instances also start on new partitions, distributing cluster load evenly across partitions.
- Process instances do not migrate between partitions, so it can take time for the cluster to reach equilibrium.
- New partitions do not take part in correlating messages/signals, except for message/signal start events.

To learn more, see [cluster scaling](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/operations/cluster-scaling.md).

:::caution
This feature is not yet fully compatible with backup/restore.

### Helm charts <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

#### Alternative container images

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2826 -->

Camunda now provides alternative container images to the previously used Bitnami images. These images are hosted on `registry.camunda.cloud`.

- From version **8.8**, these are the default supported images, offering better security and faster patch delivery.
- To use them, update your Helm deployment to reference the `values-images-ee.yml` file. See the [installation guide](/self-managed/deployment/helm/install/quick-install.md) for details.

#### Configurable volumes

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2597 -->

The Helm chart now supports configurable volumes. You can define `PersistentVolumeClaims` or continue using `EmptyDir` through `values.yaml`.

### Singapore region available for SaaS on Amazon Web Services <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

A new Singapore (ap-southeast-1) region is now available for SaaS clusters on Amazon Web Services. Use this region to:

- Improve overall processing speed and reduce latency if you operate in Singapore and Southeast Asian (SEA) countries.
- Keep cluster data within Singapore to support your local data residency and compliance needs.

To learn more about supported SaaS regions, see [regions](/components/saas/regions.md).

### Tasklist uses the Orchestration Cluster REST API <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Tasklist">Tasklist</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2516 -->

Tasklist now uses the [Orchestration Cluster REST API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md), replacing the soon-to-be-deprecated Tasklist V1 API.

- This change improves compatibility with Camunda 8 RDBMS support and continues to work with Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
- It ensures consistent functionality, better performance, and access to new features—without breaking existing workflows.

### User task listener types <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Tasklist">Tasklist</span>

New user task listener types are available:

#### `creating` event

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2625 -->

This event triggers before a user task is created.

| Functionality                  | Description                                                                                                      |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configurable creation listener | Executes logic before a task appears to users. Task is visible only after all listener jobs finish.              |
| Controlled task initialization | The creation continues only after listeners succeed. Incidents are raised if logic fails, enabling safe retries. |
| Operate UI insights            | A “Creating” event appears in the listener tab in Operate. Incidents are flagged for troubleshooting.            |
| Assign user task               | Assign a task programmatically during creation, useful when assignment depends on an external system.            |

#### `canceling` event

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2657 -->

This event triggers when a user task is canceled (e.g., by a boundary event or process termination).

| Functionality                     | Description                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configurable cancelation listener | Executes logic when a task is canceled. Allows inspection or modification of task data before completion. |
| Consistent lifecycle control      | Cancelation waits for listener logic to complete. Failures can raise incidents for safe retry.            |
| Operate UI insights               | A “Canceling” event is shown in the listener tab. Incidents are highlighted for visibility.               |

To learn more, see [user task listeners](/components/concepts/user-task-listeners.md).

### Documentation <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

#### Get started updates

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2751 -->

The [getting started](/guides/getting-started-example.md) documentation now includes:

- Example BPMN files and Spring Boot/NodeJS starter projects.
- Practical code snippets, such as payment handling.
- Updated code to match recent Camunda versions.
- Annotations in BPMN files to guide usage and explain results.

#### Public API

The new [Public API](/reference/public-api.md) documentation outlines what’s included in Camunda 8's public API, the policies around versioning, and what to expect when upgrading.

- The public API is the official contract between Camunda and its users under SemVer.
- No breaking changes will be made to the public API in minor or patch releases.
- You can safely build on these interfaces with the expectation of stability and backward compatibility.

### React to expired messages with a custom exporter

Camunda now introduces a mechanism to react to expired messages. The original message is retrieved from the primary storage upon message expiration and the expiry event is enhanced with the original message. Existing functionality remains unchanged, so there is no disruption for current customers or custom exporters.

With these updates, developers can subscribe to the expired messages through a custom exporter, examine the event content, and optionally re-publish or handle the message differently. By providing an enhanced event and re-publish flow, this feature strengthens reliability and transparency in business processes without requiring a major upgrade or modifying existing exporters.

#### Email connector {#emailalpha4}

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/connectors/pull/4657 -->

The Email connector now exposes the `Message-ID` provided by the client in the connector response payload. This allows for improved traceability, easier correlation between sent messages and logs, and better integration with downstream systems that rely on `Message-ID`.

For example:

```json
{
  "sent": true,
  "subject": "Email subject"
  "messageId": "<abc123@clientdomain.com>"
}
```

:::note
This change is backwards-compatible and does not require any action. You can now optionally use the `messageId` field for enhanced tracking when parsing connector responses.

### Camunda Spring Boot Starter for the Camunda 8 REST API

A Spring Boot Starter is provided for the Orchestration Cluster REST API to unify process management, user tasks, and identity features under a single dedicated starter. This simplifies the interaction between a Spring Boot application and Camunda 8, allowing you to:

- Easily integrate process entity management and queries within your workflows.
- Seamlessly configure endpoints and authentication via Spring Boot auto-configuration, minimizing boilerplate code.
- Rely on an official, standardized approach to guarantee consistency and reduce maintenance costs when upgrading.
- Based on Spring Boot 3.5 ([version compatibility matrix](/apis-tools/camunda-spring-boot-starter/getting-started.md#version-compatibility)).

To learn more about this feature, see the [Camunda Spring Boot Starter](/apis-tools/camunda-spring-boot-starter/getting-started.md).

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2249 -->

### Camunda 8 Run authentication updates

Camunda 8 Run no longer requires authentication when working with APIs. Authentication and authorizations can be optionally enabled to allow requests using basic authentication, and to test authorizations and permissions.

To learn more about this feature, see the [API documentation](/self-managed/quickstart/developer-quickstart/c8run.md#use-camunda-apis) for Camunda 8 Run.

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/5145 -->

### Identity management updates <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

The [Identity service](/self-managed/components/management-identity/overview.md) is enhanced to deliver greater flexibility, control, and security for both Self-Managed and SaaS users. These updates are part of our broader effort to streamline the platform’s architecture.

#### Cluster-level identity management

Identity settings will be configured at the Orchestration Cluster level, allowing each cluster to have unique OIDC configurations. This cluster-specific setup empowers organizations to assign different identity providers (IdPs) across clusters, offering improved control over permissions and user group mappings, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient configuration experience.

For SaaS customers, identity management in Camunda 8.8 remains consistent with Camunda 8.7, allowing the attachment of a single IdP per organization. However, cluster-level identity capabilities are provided for SaaS as well as Self-Managed. This means that user groups, roles, and access permissions can now be managed at the cluster level, giving SaaS customers the same granular access control as in Self-Managed environments.

#### Decoupling from Keycloak <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span>

Built-in Keycloak integration in Self-Managed is removed, allowing customers to use any compatible IdP.

- Keycloak remains fully supported as an external option. For cluster-level identity management it must be connected as an external OIDC provider moving forward.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) remains the standard for seamless integration with chosen IdPs.

#### Resource-based permissions

Resource-level permissions are introduced to control read and write permissions per specific resource.

- Admin users retain full access, but regular users must be granted specific permissions to perform operations or view resources.
- For organizations that build custom front-ends and access Camunda via API, users or Clients with API permissions can still access data through the V2 API, respecting their resource permissions.

### User task listeners <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span><span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Modeler">Modeler</span><span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects Operate">Operate</span>

Task lifecycle management is enhanced with user task listeners, allowing users to react to specific user task lifecycle events.

- Process designers can now model task listeners for different events, such as `assigning` and `completing`.
- Developers can use the same job infrastructure to activate and complete task listener jobs.
- Operations engineers can easily check details of active and completed task listeners within instances, and efficiently resolve task listener incidents.

This enhancement streamlines operations and ensures smoother incident handling, improving time to unblock process execution.

To learn more about this feature, see [user task listeners](/components/concepts/user-task-listeners.md).

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2126 -->

### Orchestration Cluster REST API Query API <span class="badge badge--medium" title="This feature affects APIs">API</span>

You can now use a single Query API in the Orchestration Cluster REST API to find process and decision data instead of using multiple component APIs.

For example, send a request to the [Search decision definitions](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/specifications/search-decision-definitions.api.mdx) endpoint to search for decision definitions.

New Query API endpoints are added as follows:

- Decision definitions
- Decision instances
- Decision requirements
- Flownode instances
- Incidents
- Process definitions
- Process instances
- User tasks
- Variables

To learn more about these endpoints, see the [Orchestration Cluster REST API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md#query-api) documentation.
