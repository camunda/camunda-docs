### Changes in supported environments

#### Zeebe Go client

- Raised minimum Go version to 1.21 for the Zeebe Go client

#### Syntax changes in Helm chart

A Camunda Helm chart upgrade is not possible from v9.x.x to v10.0.0 or v10.0.1. Instead, upgrade directly to v10.0.2+.

The Camunda Helm chart v10.0.0 has major changes in the values file structure. Some keys in the values file have been changed. For compatibility, the keys are deprecated in the Camunda release cycle 8.5 and will be removed in the Camunda 8.6 release (October 2024).

Follow the [upgrade instructions](/self-managed/deployment/helm/upgrade/index.md#helm-chart-1002+) to upgrade from Camunda Helm chart v9.x.x to Camunda Helm chart v10.x.x.

#### Support for Amazon OpenSearch

With the 8.5 release, Optimize is now also compatible with [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/de/opensearch-service/) 2.5+. Note that using Amazon OpenSearch requires [setting up a new Camunda installation](/versioned_docs/version-8.5/self-managed/setup/overview.md). A migration from previous versions or Elasticsearch environments is not supported.

This release contains the following limitations:

- In **Optimize `8.5.0`**
  - **Limitation**
    - **Description:** OpenSearch support in Optimize is limited to data import and the raw data report.
    - **Reference:** n/a
    - **Mitigation:** Optimize can be installed and used in production with limited reporting functionality. Optimize imports all process data generated by Zeebe. All reporting functionality as described in the docs will be delivered with upcoming patches.
- In **Console `8.5.x`**
  - **Limitation**
    - **Description:** Custom OIDC provider support for Console is not supported
    - **Reference:** https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues/784

### Key changes

#### Deprecation of Self-Managed AWS Marketplace offering

As of **October 2025**, the **Self-Managed AWS Marketplace** offering will be **deprecated** and no longer publicly available.  
Existing customers may continue to use the product until their contracts expire.

For future use, refer to our [new AWS Marketplace listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-6y664fcnydiqg?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) for more information.

#### Removal of Web Modeler's beta API

The Web Modeler beta API has been removed. The API was deprecated in 8.3 and is no longer available in 8.5. Use the [Web Modeler v1 API](/versioned_docs/version-8.5/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/index.md) instead.
For a migration guide, see the [Web Modeler API documentation](/versioned_docs/version-8.5/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/index.md#migrating-from-beta-to-v1).

#### Zeebe 8.5.0 breaks serialization of timestamp values in management API (Self-Managed only)

Zeebe 8.5.0 was released with [a new bug](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/issues/17347) that breaks serialization of timestamp values in management APIs, such as [backup](/versioned_docs/version-8.5/self-managed/operational-guides/backup-restore/backup-and-restore.md) and [cluster scaling](/versioned_docs/version-8.5/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/cluster-scaling.md).
Timestamps which were previously serialized as `ISO8061` strings are now serialized as integer values.

Until a fix is delivered in 8.5.1, workarounds include not deserializing timestamp values from affected APIs, or deserializing them as integers.

### Camunda 8 Self-Managed

#### Helm

##### ExtraVolumeClaimTemplates

You can now add custom `extraVolumeClaimTemplates` to the Zeebe/Core StatefulSet by supplying an array of templates in your Helm values file. This allows you to attach additional persistent volumes to each Zeebe/Core pod for use cases such as custom storage or log directories.

**Important:**  
Kubernetes does not allow you to change the `volumeClaimTemplates` of an existing StatefulSet. If you add, remove, or modify `extraVolumeClaimTemplates` after initial deployment, you must delete and recreate the StatefulSet (which will also delete the pods) for the changes to take effect. This may require additional planning and data migration steps to avoid data loss.

##### Common labels for Camunda resources

A new `commonLabels` value is now available and integrates with `camundaPlatform.labels`. This allows you to define mutable labels that are automatically applied to all Camunda resources. By setting `commonLabels`, you can ensure consistent labeling across deployments, making it easier to manage, organize, and identify resources within your Camunda environment.

##### Configure Web Modeler replicas

The number of replicas for the Web Modeler REST API and web app deployments can be set with new configuration properties: `webModeler.restapi.replicas` and `webModeler.webapp.replicas`, respectively.

##### Bitnami Docker repository migration

The Camunda Helm charts have been updated to use the new Bitnami Docker repository.
See [Bitnami Docker repository migration](/self-managed/deployment/helm/upgrade/index.md#bitnami-docker-repository-migration) for migration details.
