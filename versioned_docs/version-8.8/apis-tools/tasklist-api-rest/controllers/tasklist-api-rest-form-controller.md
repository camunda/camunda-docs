#### Method

`GET`

#### Request parameters

| Parameter name       | Type  | Required | Description                                        |

| formId               | path  | `true`   | ID of the form                                     |

:::info
In Camunda, there are two types of forms: embedded forms and deployed forms.

Embedded forms are stored in the process definition and are not versioned. The `formId` is a value generated by the internal Tasklist API and is distinct from the ID specified in the form editor. When retrieving a task, the key follows the format `camunda-forms:bpmn:<formId>`, and only the `<formId>` segment is required to access the form schema.

Deployed forms in Camunda are forms that are reusable between multiple processes, allowing for standardized and consistent form usage across various workflows. The `formId` is unique by the form and set by the developer on the process of the form design. The `version` is specifically used for deployed forms and increases after a new form deployment. When it is null, the system returns the latest active version of the form.

#### HTTP request example

Send a token issue GET request to the authorization server with the following content:

```
{
  "form_id": "<form-id>",
  "process_definition_key": "<process-definition-key>",
  "version": "<version>",
}
```

Refer to the following example with curl:

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://{host}/v1/forms/{formId}?processDefinitionKey={processDefinitionKey}&version={formVersion}' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {yourBearerToken}'
```
