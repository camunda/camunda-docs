## Introduction

The Tasklist API is a REST API designed to build task applications for human-centered processes. The API allows you to query user tasks, assign users to these tasks, and complete these tasks.

:::note
Ensure you [authenticate](./tasklist-api-rest-authentication.md) before accessing the Tasklist API.

## Context paths

For SaaS: `https://${REGION}.tasklist.camunda.io:443/${CLUSTER_ID}/v1/`, and for Self-Managed installations: `http://localhost:8080/v1/`.

:::note
Find your **region Id** and **cluster Id** under **Connection information** in your client credentials (revealed when you click on your client under the **API** tab within your cluster).

For Self-Managed, the host and port depend on your configuration. The context path mentioned here is the default for the Tasklist component.
