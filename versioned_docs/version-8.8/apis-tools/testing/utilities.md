There are different utilities that can help you to write your process test.

## Manipulate the clock

The Camunda runtime uses an internal clock to execute process instances and to calculate when a BPMN timer event is due. In a test, you can use `CamundaProcessTestContext` to manipulate the clock.

When to use it:

- Trigger an active BPMN timer event
- Test scenarios that require a specific date or time, for example, a leap year

```java
@Test
void shouldTriggerTimerEvent() {
    // given: a process instance waiting at a BPMN timer event

    // when
    assertThat(processInstance).hasActiveElements("wait_2_days");

    processTestContext.increaseTime(Duration.ofDays(2));

    // then
    assertThat(processInstance).hasCompletedElements("wait_2_days");
}
```
