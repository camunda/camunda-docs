Forms play a key role in giving work instructions, collecting information and making decisions within human task orchestration. Forms are lightweight user interfaces, tailored for focused data input in specific steps of a process, rendering the orchestration of human tasks more efficient than simply routing users to the applications that are orchestrated.

Forms are commonly used in [user tasks](/components/modeler/bpmn/user-tasks/user-tasks.md#user-task-forms), but also as [start forms](/components/tasklist/userguide/starting-processes.md) to start a new process instance, or even as [public forms](/components/modeler/web-modeler/advanced-modeling/publish-public-processes.md), e.g. to capture user input at scale or to allow your customers to trigger a self-service process.

## Camunda Forms

In Camunda 8, you can design forms using a drag'n'drop editor. The form editor is available in both Desktop and Web Modeler. Learn more about Camunda Forms and available components in the [Camunda Forms reference documentation](/components/modeler/forms/camunda-forms-reference.md), and learn how to design a human workflow with forms in the [getting started guide](/guides/getting-started-orchestrate-human-tasks.md).

## form-js

Camunda Forms present a flexible, open solution to form creation. Camunda Forms are based on the [form-js library](https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js) <GHIcon />, maintained by Camunda. As a result, the form editor and renderer are non-proprietary, open-source technology, and can be used everywhere, also outside the context of Camunda 8. This unlocks a world of use cases, and eliminates any doubt around vendor lock-in or technical barriers.

Form-js is a vanilla JavaScript library with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) in the background, and can be used in any framework, from Angular to React.

The resulting forms are serialized as a JSON document. The JSON document conforms to an open form schema that allows you to render the form using both the built-in form render, or even with a custom render. The form schema is extensible, allowing you to build your own extensions or custom components.
