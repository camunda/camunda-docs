This page describes the available authentication methods for accessing the Zeebe API (gRPC) in the Orchestration Cluster. Similar to the Orchestration Cluster REST API, the Zeebe API supports three authentication methods:

- **No Authentication**
- **Basic Authentication**
- **OIDC-based Authentication**

Please refer to the [Orchestration Cluster API authentication guide](./../orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-authentication.md) for more details on each method and general guidance on usage.
