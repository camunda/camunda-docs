Camunda Docs AI provides a smart AI-powered chatbot that helps you find answers to your technical and non-technical questions about Camunda within Web Modeler, rather than navigating and searching across multiple sources of information like documentation, forums, blog posts, etc.

Click the **Camunda Docs AI** widget in the bottom right corner of a BPMN/DMN canvas to open the chatbot:

Here, you can ask questions like _How do I design a process?_, _What is BPMN?_, and more.
