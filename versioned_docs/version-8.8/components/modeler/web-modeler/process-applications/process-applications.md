In Web Modeler a [process application](../../../concepts/process-applications.md) is a type of folder that contains a main process BPMN diagram and a set of related files you can work on and [deploy](deploy-process-application.md) as a single bundle.

For example, a process application for a consumer loan application might consist of a main process BPMN diagram and a number of additional supporting files, such as DMN diagrams and forms.

## Process application development lifecycle

In Web Modeler your can quickly develop and progress low-risk process application releases through the stages of a typical development lifecycle.

- [Process application development lifecycle](process-application-pipeline.md)

## Create a process application

Get started by creating a new process application.

- When you [create a process application](./create-a-process-application.md), you must select a cluster to use for deployment during development.
- A process application must always have a [main process](./create-a-process-application.md#main-process). You can rename and reassign the main process at any time.
- You can [add files](./create-a-process-application.md#add-files-to-a-process-application) to the process application as required.

## Validate and deploy your process application

Validate your process application in development before deploying it to testing, staging, or production.

- [Validate and deploy your process application](deploy-process-application.md)

## Process application versioning

Use versioning to save a single snapshot of all the process application files in one action.

- [Process application versioning](process-application-versioning.md)

## Known limitations

You should be aware of the following limitations when working with process applications.

### General limitations

- You cannot create folders inside a process application folder.
- Self-Managed does not support defining cluster stages, identifying clusters by tags, or cluster promotion.

### Deployment limitations

- Process applications can only be deployed to a Zeebe cluster in version 8.4.0 or higher.
- You cannot deploy individual files that are part of a process application; the application is always deployed as a whole.
- When you deploy a process application, only the main process is validated for missing [Connector secrets](../../../console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md).
- The overall size of the deployment bundle is limited due to a maximum [record](../../../zeebe/technical-concepts/internal-processing.md) size of 4 MB in Zeebe.
  - The limit is effectively between 2 and 3 MB, as Zeebe writes more data to the log stream than just the raw deployment.
  - If you exceed the limit, you are shown an [error message](deploy-process-application.md#deployment-errors):<br/>
    `Command 'CREATE' rejected with code 'EXCEEDED_BATCH_RECORD_SIZE'`.
