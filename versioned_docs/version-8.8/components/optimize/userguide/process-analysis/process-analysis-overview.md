description: Further analyze your reports, and learn more about branch and task analysis.

The following documentation provides an opportunity to further analyze your reports through several methods:

- [Task analysis](./task-analysis.md): Task analysis allows you to easily identify process instances where certain flow node instances took significantly longer than others and subsequently slow down your process.
- [Branch analysis](./branch-analysis.md): If a process contains more than one end event, it is useful to know which path tokens took to reach a specific end event. Optimize provides you with a statistical analysis for a given end event and a gateway.
