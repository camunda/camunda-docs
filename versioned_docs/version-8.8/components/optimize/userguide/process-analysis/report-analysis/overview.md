## Edit mode

The [edit mode](./edit-mode.md) allows you to configure the report and adjust it to your needs. The following operations are possible within edit mode:

- Rename your report
- Add/edit/remove description
- Build a report
- Configure your report
- Save the current state with your applied changes
- Cancel changes you already applied to the report

## View mode

Once you have defined what your report should look like, the [view mode](./view-mode.md) gives you a full view of the report visualization. To see more details about the report, you can interact with it, e.g. by moving your mouse over individual data points in diagrams or zooming in or out of heatmaps. The kind of interaction always depends on the report itself.
