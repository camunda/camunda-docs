:::info
The **Google Gemini Connector** is available for `8.7.0` or later.
:::

The **Google Gemini Connector** is an outbound Connector that allows you to access Gemini multimodal models from Google. It is capable of understanding virtually any input, and can combine different types of information in a BPMN process.

## Create a Google Gemini Connector task

import ConnectorTask from '../../../components/react-components/connector-task.md'

<ConnectorTask/>

## Make your Google Gemini Connector executable

To execute this Connector, ensure all mandatory fields are correctly filled.

:::note
All the mandatory and non-mandatory fields and required settings depending on the operation selection you choose are covered in the upcoming sections.
:::

## Authentication

Choose an authentication type from the **Type** dropdown. For details on authentication types, see [Google authentication types](#google-authentication-types).

## Project ID

Enter your google cloud project identifier.

## Region

Enter the region where your project is located. For example, `us-central1 (lowa)`, `us-west1 (Oregon)`.

## Model

Select a model from the dropdown. The following models are currently supported:

- gemini-1.5-flash-001
- gemini-1.5-flash-002
- gemini-1.5-pro-001
- gemini-1.5-pro-002
- gemini-1.0-pro-001
- gemini-1.0-pro-002
- gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001

## Prompt

Enter a prompt as a FEEL expression, providing text and media.

- To provide text to Gemini, your expression should contain key _"text"_ and text data. For example, _"text"_ : _"your text"_
- To provide media to Gemini, your expression should contain key _"mime"_ and mime type text, and key _"uri"_ and media URI. For example, _"mime"_: _"mime type"_, _"uri"_: _"your URI"_.

For example:

```feel
= [{"text": "who is this video about"},
{"mime": "video/*", "uri": "https://youtu.be/..."}]
```

## System instructions

Enter system instructions as a string, to determine how the model should respond.

To learn more about system instructions, refer to [Google system instructions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/system-instructions?hl=en).

## Grounding

Grounding connects the model output to the verifiable sources of information.

- This is useful in situations where accuracy and reliability are important.
- To use grounding, select the _Grounding_ checkbox and input the path to the data store.

To learn more about grounding, refer to [Google grounding overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview?hl=en).

## Safety Filter Settings

You can adjust the likelihood of receiving a model response which might contain harmful content.

- Content is blocked based on the probability that it is harmful.
- To use safety filter settings, select the _Safety Filter Settings_ checkbox and select the desired level from dropdown.
- By default, all filters are set to OFF.

To learn more about safety filters, refer to [Google responsible AI safety filters and settings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai?hl=en#safety_filters_and_attributes).

## Add stop sequence

A stop sequence is a series of characters (including spaces) that stops response generation if encountered by the model.

The stop sequence should be inserted as a string list.

For example:

```feel
= ["text 1", "text 2"]
```

## Temperature

The **Temperature** controls the randomness in token selection.

- A lower temperature is good when you expect a true or correct response. A temperature of `0` means the highest probability token is usually selected.
- A higher temperature can lead to diverse or unexpected results. Some models have a higher temperature max to encourage more random responses.

## Output token limit

The **Output token limit** Determines the maximum amount of text output from a single prompt. A token is approximately four characters.

## Seed

Setting a **Seed** value is useful if you make repeated requests and want the same model response.

Deterministic outcome isnâ€™t guaranteed. Changing the model or other settings can cause variations in the response even when you use the same seed value.

## Top-K

The **Top-K** specifies the number of candidate tokens when the model is selecting an output token.

- Use a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses.
- Only the _gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001_ model supports Top-K.

## Top-P

The **Top-P** changes how the model selects tokens for output.

- Tokens are selected from the most probable to the least probable, until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-p value.
- For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of .3, .2, and .1 and the top-p value is .5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token (using temperature).
- For the least variable results, set top-P to 0.

## Functional call description

**Function calling** is a feature of Gemini models that makes it easier to get structured data outputs from generative models.

- The **Functional call description** must be provided in fell format.
- It is important that all types must be registered with capslock.

To learn more about function calling, refer to [Google function calling](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling).

For example:

```fell
[
  {
    "name": "get_exchange_rate",
    "description":"Get the exchange rate for currencies between countries",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "OBJECT",
      "properties": {
        "currency_date": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "A date that must always be in YYYY-MM-DD format or the value 'latest' if a time period is not specified"
        },
        "currency_from": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "The currency to convert from in ISO 4217 format"
        },
        "currency_to": {
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "The currency to convert to in ISO 4217 format"
        }
      },
      "required":[
        "currency_date",
        "currency_from",
        "currency_to"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Google authentication types

The **Google Gemini Connector** currently supports two methods for authentication and authorization:

- Based on a short-lived JWT bearer token.
- Based on a refresh token.

Google supports multiple ways to obtain both types of token. Refer to the [official Google OAuth documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for current instructions, or see the examples below.

#### Example 1: Obtain JWT bearer token with a service account

:::danger
The following code snippet is for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
For production usage, follow the [official Google guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account).
:::

Assuming you have created a service account and downloaded a JSON file with keys, run the following Python 3 snippet to print the JWT token in the terminal:

```python
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
from google.oauth2 import service_account
# Scopes required to execute 'create' endpoind with Google Drive API
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata']
# File with keys
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'google-service-account-creds.json'
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)
auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
credentials.refresh(auth_req)
# Print token
print(credentials.token)
```

#### Example 2: Obtain bearer and refresh token with OAuth client

:::danger
The following code snippet is for demonstration purposes only and must not be used for real production systems due to security concerns.
For production usage, follow the [official Google guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).
:::

Assuming you have created an OAuth client, you can download key files from the Google [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Run the following Python 3 snippet to print the refresh token in the terminal:

```python
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
import pprint

SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents']
OAUTH_KEYS = './oauth-keys.json' # path to your file with OAuth credentials

def main():
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(OAUTH_KEYS, SCOPES)
    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=54948)
    pprint.pprint(vars(creds))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
