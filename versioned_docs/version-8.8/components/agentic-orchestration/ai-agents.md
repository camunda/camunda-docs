## About AI agents

<p><img src={AgentImg} title="An AI agent in a process" alt="An AI agent in a process"  className="img-transparent" style={{border:0,padding:0,paddingLeft:30,paddingTop:10,margin:0,marginLeft:10,float: 'right', width: '45%'}}/>An AI agent is a software program that autonomously gathers data and carries out tasks using this information, independently or on behalf of another system or person.</p>

- AI agents can perform a variety of functions, including making decisions, solving problems, interacting with external environments, and taking actions.

- For example, you can use an AI agent to select and execute tasks within an ad-hoc sub-process, by evaluating the current process context and determining the relevant tasks and tools to use in response.

## AI agent integration features

Use the following Camunda 8 features to integrate AI agents into your processes:

<table className="table-callout">
<tr>
    <td width="30%">**Feature**</td>
    <td>**Description**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>[Ad-hoc sub-process](/components/modeler/bpmn/ad-hoc-subprocesses/ad-hoc-subprocesses.md)</td>
    <td>A special kind of embedded BPMN subprocess with an ad-hoc marker that allows a small part of your process decision-making to be handed over to a human or agent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>[AI agent connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent.md)</td>
    <td>Enables AI agents to integrate with an LLM to provide interaction/reasoning capabilities. This connector is designed for use with an ad-hoc sub-process in a feedback loop, providing automated user interaction and tool selection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>[MCP Client connector](/components/early-access/alpha/mcp-client/mcp-client.md)</td>
    <td>Connect an AI agent connector to tools exposed by [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>[Ad-hoc tools schema resolver connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-ahsp-tools-schema-resolver.md)</td>
    <td>Can be used independently with other AI connectors for direct LLM interaction. Use this connector if you donâ€™t want to use the AI agent connector but still want to resolve tools for an ad-hoc sub-process or debug tool definitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>[Vector database connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/embeddings-vector-db.md)</td>
    <td>Allows embedding, storing, and retrieving LLM embeddings. Use this connector to build AI-based solutions such as context document search, long-term memory for LLMs, and agentic AI interaction.</td>
</tr>

## Integrate an AI agent into your process

A common model for AI agent integration uses an ad-hoc sub-process and AI agent connector in a [tools feedback loop](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent-subprocess-example.md).

In this model, an AI agent is defined using an AI agent connector, with the tools available to the agent defined in an ad-hoc sub-process. The AI agent is able to understand the context and process goal, and uses the available tools to complete the goal.
