## Managing hardware packages

Once signed up for the **Enterprise plan**, you have access to the **Billing** page.

- The created process instances from the current period are displayed at the top of the page.
- Find a history of the metrics on a monthly basis at the bottom of the page.
- View how many hardware packages are included on the right side of the page.

Reservations control how many clusters you can deploy. Increasing the number of reservations allows you to deploy more clusters, while decreasing the number of reservations allows you to deploy fewer clusters.

You can access the **Billing** page by selecting **Organization management** in the Camunda Console navigation bar.
