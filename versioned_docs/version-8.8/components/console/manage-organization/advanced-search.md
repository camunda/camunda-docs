To ease navigation throughout Console, utilize the **search functionality** available in Camunda 8 SaaS under the **Console** component.

This search functionality allows users to:

- Navigate between apps, actions, and tasks (e.g. go to Modeler, invite users, API clients, etc.)
- Locate Camunda project assets (e.g. BPMN, DMN models, and clusters).
- Find all entries in the Camunda forum, documentation, and public GitHub issues.

## Open the search bar

Press `Ctrl+K`, `⌘+K`, or click the magnifier in the top navigation bar to open the search bar.

## Tips

- Type `>` to execute an action in Console. By using `#` as a prefix, you search only in docs.
- Use the keyboard arrows (◀ ▲ ▼ ▶) to navigate through results.
- If you observe a ▶ symbol on the right-hand side, click to reveal more information.
- To select a result, press **Enter**.
