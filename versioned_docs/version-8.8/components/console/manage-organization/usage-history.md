The usage history is visible only to owners and admins for Trial, Enterprise, and Starter organizations.

Three key metrics play a role in paid plans: the number of started process instances, decision instances, and the number of task users. The **Usage** tab, under the **Organization management**, provides a usage view for these metrics across the organization.

The section is split into two areas:

**Table view**, where data from production clusters is displayed aggregated on a monthly basis:

**Chart view**, where data from production and development clusters is displayed in charts and allows a closer look into usage patterns and spikes by customizing the date ranges.
