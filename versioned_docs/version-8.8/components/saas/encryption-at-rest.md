Encryption at rest protects stored data by making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.

## Overview

By default, Camunda 8 SaaS uses a provider-managed encryption key with [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) encryption](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption). Enterprise customers can choose:

- Camunda-managed software or hardware keys (Google KMS)
- Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) on AWS for full control

Key points:

- Encryption type is selected only when [creating a cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md)
- Each cluster can have its own key
- The key applies to all workloads and persists across updates
- View encryption details in **Cluster Details** on the **Console Overview** tab

:::note
Backups use default provider GCP encryption.

| Hardware key       | Camunda    | Google KMS hardware (HSM) protection; FIPS 140-2 Level 3; operations in HSM; zero downtime rotation |
| BYOK               | Customer   | AWS KMS key; full control over lifecycle, rotation, and revocation; enterprise only                 |

## Provider encryption key
