A user group is a way to organize multiple [users](user.md) in one unit. Groups simplify access management by allowing you to assign permissions to a collection of users at once, rather than individually. You can grant permissions to a group by assigning [roles](role.md) to it or creating direct [authorizations](authorization.md).

## Create a group

To create a group:

1. Log in to Identity in your cluster, and click on the **Groups** tab.
2. Click on the **Create group** button, and provide the following group details:
   - **Group ID**: The unique identifier for the group.
   - **Name**: The name of the group.
   - **Description**: A description of the group.
3. Click on the **Create group** button.

The group is created and can now be assigned to roles or users.
