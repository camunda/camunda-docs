Zeebe is the process automation engine powering Camunda Platform 8. While written in Java, you do not need to be a Java developer to use Zeebe.

With Zeebe you can:

- Define processes graphically in [BPMN 2.0](../modeler/bpmn/bpmn-coverage.md).
- Choose any [gRPC](/apis-tools/grpc.md)-supported programming language to implement your workers.
- Build processes that react to events from Apache Kafka and other messaging platforms.
- Use as part of a software as a service (SaaS) offering with Camunda Platform 8 or deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises) with Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed.
- Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput.
- Rely on fault tolerance and high availability for your processes.
- Export processes data for monitoring and analysis (currently only available through the [Elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/tree/develop/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter) added in Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed).
- Engage with an active community.

For documentation on deploying Zeebe as part of Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed, refer to the [deployment guide](../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/zeebe-installation.md).

## Enterprise support for Zeebe

Paid support for Zeebe is available via either Camunda Platform 8 Professional or Camunda Platform 8 Enterprise. Customers can choose either plan based on their process automation requirements. Camunda Platform 8 Enterprise customers also have the option of on-premises or private cloud deployment.

Additionally, regardless of how you are working with Zeebe and Camunda Platform 8, you can always find support through the [community](open-source/get-help-get-involved.md).
