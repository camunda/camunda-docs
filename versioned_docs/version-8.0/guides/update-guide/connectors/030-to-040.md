The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from
[Connector SDK](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md)
0.3.x to 0.4.0.

:::caution

Be aware that the update from 0.3 to 0.4 requires manual migration steps as described below.

:::

With SDK version 0.4.0, we introduce a lot of basic structural changes:

- Switching default Connector Runtime to Spring Boot / Spring Zeebe for outbound connectors.
- Introducing webhook inbound connector
- Moved out-of-the-box connectors to mono-repo at https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/tree/main/connectors to ease dependency management and conflict resolution
- Build Connector bundle artifact and Docker image by Maven as default (was done by adding various fat jars to one Docker image)
- Adding GCP Secret Provider used in Camunda SaaS
