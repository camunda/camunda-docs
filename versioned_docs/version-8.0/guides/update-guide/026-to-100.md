title: Update 0.26 to 1.0
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 0.26.x to 1.0.0."
---

<span class="badge badge--primary">Intermediate</span>

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 0.26.x to 1.0.0 for each component of the system.

:::caution

Be aware that the major version update from 0.26 to 1.0 is not backwards
compatible. Therefore, data cannot be migrated from 0.26 to 1.0 and client
applications must be adjusted to the new API versions.

## Server

### Zeebe

#### Distribution

With Zeebe 1.0.0, the Java package names were adjusted. They changed from
`io.zeebe` to `io.camunda.zeebe`. Therefore, any logging configurations and
similar, which are based on the package names, must be adjusted.

Additionally, the group id of the Java artifacts were migrated from `io.zeebe`
to `io.camunda`. This requires all dependencies to the artifacts to be updated
to use the new group id.

The downloadable artifact of the Zeebe distribution was renamed from:

- `zeebe-distribution-${VERSION}.tar.gz` to `camunda-cloud-zeebe-${VERSION}.tar.gz`,
- `zeebe-distribution-${VERSION}.zip` to `camunda-cloud-zeebe-${VERSION}.zip`

#### Workflow Engine

The support for YAML workflows was removed from the workflow engine, after the
deprecation with 0.26. This means only [BPMN
processes](/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn-primer.md) are supported from now on.

#### Elasticsearch Exporter

The supported Elasticsearch version of the Elasticsearch Exporter was increased
from `6.8` to `7.10`, read more about this in the
[Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch) section.

The index templates of the Elasticsearch Exporter were migrated to use
[composable index templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-templates.html).

#### Exporter API

In the Java Exporter API, the depracted method `Controller#scheduleTask` was removed.

### Operate

With Operate 1.0.0, the Java package names were adjusted. They changed from
`org.camunda.operate` to `io.camunda.operate`. Therefore, any logging
configurations and similar, which are based on the package names, must be
adjusted.

The downloadable artifact of the Operate distribution was renamed from:

- `camunda-operate-${VERSION}.tar.gz` to `camunda-cloud-operate-${VERSION}.tar.gz`,
- `camunda-operate-${VERSION}.zip` to `camunda-cloud-operate-${VERSION}.zip`

The supported Elasticsearch version was increased from `6.8` to `7.10`. Read
more about this in the [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch) section.

### Tasklist

With Tasklist 1.0.0, the Java package names were adjusted. They changed from
`io.zeebe.tasklist` to `io.camunda.tasklist`. Therefore, any logging
configurations and similar, which are based on the package names, must be
adjusted.

Additionally, the configuration prefix was migrated from `zeebe.tasklist` to
`camunda.tasklist`, which requires all configurations to be adjusted to the new
prefix.

The downloadable artifact of the Tasklist distribution was renamed from:

- `zeebe-tasklist-${VERSION}.tar.gz` to `camunda-cloud-tasklist-${VERSION}.tar.gz`,
- `zeebe-tasklist-${VERSION}.zip` to `camunda-cloud-tasklist-${VERSION}.zip`

The supported Elasticsearch version was increased from `6.8` to `7.10`. Read
more about this in the [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch) section.

### Elasticsearch

Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist use Elasticsearch as Datastore to exchange the event
stream from Zeebe's exporter, and store their own data model representation.

Camunda Cloud 1.0 requires an update from Elasticsearch 6.8 to 7.10.

Follow the [update guide from
Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html),
to migrate existing data.

:::note
Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist data inside Elasticsearch cannot be migrated, it can only be preserved for
histroy or audit purpose, but cannot be loaded by Camunda Cloud 1.0.
:::

If you want to keep the existing data in Elasticsearch, ensure you set a
new index prefix for all systems. See the configuration documentation for
[Zeebe](self-managed/zeebe-deployment/zeebe-installation.md),
[Operate](self-managed/operate-deployment/operate-configuration.md), and [Tasklist](self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md).

## Client

### Zeebe Java Client

With Zeebe 1.0.0, the Java package names were adjusted. They changed from
`io.zeebe` to `io.camunda.zeebe`. Therefore, any imports and logging
configurations and similar, which are based on the package names, must be
adjusted.

Additionally, the group id of the Java artifacts were migrated from `io.zeebe`
to `io.camunda`. This requires all dependencies to the artifacts to be updated
to use the new group id.

The public API of the Java client changed as follows:

- Interface `ActivatedJob`

  - rename method `getWorkflowInstanceKey` to `getProcessInstanceKey`
  - rename method `getWorkflowDefinitionVersion` to `getProcessDefinitionVersion`
  - rename method `getWorkflowKey` to `getProcessDefinitionKey`

- Class `ClientProperties`

  - remove deprecated field `BROKER_CONTACTPOINT`

- Interface `ZeebeClientBuilder`

  - remove deprecated method `brokerContactPoint`

- Interface `ZeebeClientConfiguration`

  - remove deprecated method `getBrokerContactPoint`

- Interface `ZeebeClient`
  - change return type of `newDeployCommand` from `DeployWorkflowCommandStep1` to `DeployProcessCommandStep1`
  - change return type of `newCreateInstanceCommand` from `CreateWorkflowInstanceCommandStep1` to `CreateProcessInstanceCommandStep1`
  - change return type of `newCancelInstanceCommand` from `CancelWorkflowInstanceCommandStep1` to `CancelProcessInstanceCommandStep1`

### Zeebe Go Client

The repository of Zeebe was moved from `github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe` to
`github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe`. Therefore, all go dependencies and imports must be adjusted to the new GitHub URL.

The public API of the Go client was changed as follows:

- Interface `CancelInstanceStep1`

  - rename method `WorkflowInstanceKey` to `ProcessInstanceKey` and change return type from `DispatchCancelWorkflowInstanceCommand` to `DispatchCancelProcessInstanceCommand`

- Interface `DispatchCancelWorkflowInstanceCommand` renamed to `DispatchCancelProcessInstanceCommand`

- Interface `CancelWorkflowInstanceCommand` renamed to `CancelProcessInstanceCommand`

  - rename method `WorkflowInstanceKey` to `ProcessInstanceKey`

- Interface `CreateInstanceCommandStep1`

  - rename method `WorkflowKey` to `ProcessDefinitionKey` and change `DispatchCancelProcessInstanceCommand`

- Struct `DeployCommand`

  - method `AddResource(definition, name, resourceType)` remove `resourceType` from parameter list

- Interface `Client`
  - rename method `NewDeployWorkflowCommand` to `NewDeployProcessCommand`
