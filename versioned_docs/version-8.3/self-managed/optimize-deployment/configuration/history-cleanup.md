title: "History cleanup"
description: "Make sure that old data is automatically removed from Optimize."
---

To satisfy data protection laws or just for general storage management purposes, Optimize provides an automated cleanup functionality.

There are four types of history cleanup:

- Process data cleanup
- Decision data cleanup
- External event cleanup
- External variable cleanup

By default, all four types of history cleanup are disabled. They can be enabled individually by config and the cleanup is applied accordingly.

:::note Note for Camunda 7 users
By default, history cleanup is disabled in Optimize when running in Camunda 7. Before enabling it, you should consider the type of cleanup and time to live period that fits to your needs. Otherwise, historic data intended for analysis might get lost irreversibly.

The default [engine history cleanup](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/history/#history-cleanup) in Camunda 7 works differently than the one in Optimize due to the possible cleanup strategies. The current implementation in Optimize is equivalent to the [end time strategy](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/history/#end-time-based-strategy) of the Engine.

## Setup

The most important settings are `cronTrigger` and `ttl`; their global default configuration is the following:

```
historyCleanup:
  cronTrigger: '0 1 * * *'
  ttl: 'P2Y'
```

`cronTrigger` - defines at what interval and when the history cleanup should be performed in the format of a cron expression. The default is 1AM every day. To avoid any impact on daily business, it is recommended to schedule the cleanup outside of business hours.

See the [Configuration Description](./system-configuration.md#history-cleanup-settings) for further insights into this property and its format.

`ttl` - is the global time to live period of data contained in Optimize. The field that defines the age of a particular entity differs between process, decision, and event data. Refer to the corresponding subsection in regard to that.
The default value is `'P2Y'`, which means by default data older than _2 years_ at the point in time when the cleanup is executed gets cleaned up.
For details on the notation, see the [Configuration Description](./system-configuration.md#history-cleanup-settings) of the ttl property.

All the remaining settings are entity type specific and will be explained in the following subsections.

### Process data cleanup

The age of process instance data is determined by the `endTime` field of each process instance. Running instances are never cleaned up.

To enable the cleanup of process instance data, the `historyCleanup.processDataCleanup.enabled` property needs to be set to `true`.

Another important configuration parameter for process instance cleanup is the `historyCleanup.processDataCleanup.cleanupMode`. It determines what in particular gets deleted when a process instance is cleaned up. The default value of `all` results in the whole process instance being deleted.
For other options, review the [configuration description](./system-configuration.md#history-cleanup-settings) of the `historyCleanup.processDataCleanup.cleanupMode` property.

To set up a process definition-specific `ttl` or different `cleanupMode` you can also provide process specific settings using the `perProcessDefinitionConfig` list which overrides the global settings for the corresponding definition key.

In this example, process instances of the key `MyProcessDefinitionKey` would be cleaned up after two months instead of two years, and when the cleanup is performed, only their associated variables would be deleted instead of the complete process instance.

```
historyCleanup:
  ttl: 'P2Y'
  processDataCleanup:
    enabled: true
    cleanupMode: 'all'
    perProcessDefinitionConfig:
      'MyProcessDefinitionKey':
        ttl: 'P2M'
        cleanupMode: 'variables'
```

### Decision data cleanup

The age of decision instance data is determined by the `evaluationTime` field of each decision instance.

To enable the cleanup of decision instance data, the `historyCleanup.decisionDataCleanup.enabled` property needs to be set to `true`.

Like for the [Process Data Cleanup](#process-data-cleanup), it is possible to configure a decision definition specific `ttl` using the `perDecisionDefinitionConfig` list.

```
historyCleanup:
  ttl: 'P2Y'
  decisionDataCleanup:
    enabled: true
    perDecisionDefinitionConfig:
      'myDecisionDefinitionKey':
        ttl: 'P3M'
```

### Ingested event cleanup

The age of ingested event data is determined by the [`time`](##request-body) field provided for each event at the time of ingestion.

To enable the cleanup of event data, the `historyCleanup.ingestedEventCleanup.enabled` property needs to be set to `true`.

```
historyCleanup:
  ttl: 'P2Y'
  ingestedEventCleanup:
    enabled: true
```

:::note
The ingested event cleanup does not cascade down to potentially existing [event-based processes](#) that may contain data originating from ingested events. To make sure data of ingested events is also removed from event-based processes, you need to enable the [Process Data Cleanup](#process-data-cleanup) as well.

## Example

Here is an example of what a complete cleanup configuration might look like:

```
historyCleanup:
  cronTrigger: '0 1 * * 0'
  ttl: 'P1Y'
  processDataCleanup:
    enabled: true
    cleanupMode: 'variables'
    perProcessDefinitionConfig:
      'VeryConfidentProcess':
        ttl: 'P1M'
        cleanupMode: 'all'
      'KeepTwoMonthsProcess':
        ttl: 'P2M'
  decisionDataCleanup:
    enabled: true
    perDecisionDefinitionConfig:
      'myDecisionDefinitionKey':
        ttl: 'P3M'
  ingestedEventCleanup:
    enabled: true
```

The above configuration results in the following setup:

- The cleanup is scheduled to run every Sunday at 1AM.
- The global `ttl` of any data is one year.
- The process data cleanup is enabled.
- The `cleanupMode` performed on all process instances that passed the `ttl` period is just clearing their variable data but keeping the overall instance data like activityInstances.
- There is a process specific setup for the process definition key `'VeryConfidentProcess'` that has a special `ttl` of one month and those will be deleted completely due the specific `cleanupMode: 'all'` configuration for them.
- There is another process specific setup for the process definition key `'KeepTwoMonthsProcess'` that has a special `ttl` of two months.
- The decision data cleanup is enabled.
- There is a decision definition specific setup for the definition key `myDecisionDefinitionKey` that has a special `ttl` of three months.
- The ingested event cleanup is enabled.
