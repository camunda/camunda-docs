title: "Export report result data"
description: "The REST API to export report result data from Optimize."
---

The data export API allows users to export large amounts of data in a machine-readable format (JSON) from Optimize.

## Functionality

Users can export all report types (except combined process reports) from `Optimize` using the Data Export API. Moreover, raw data reports will include additional data relating to the executed flow nodes and can be exported in a paginated fashion, so that large amounts of data can be consumed in chunks by the client.

### Pagination

The simplest way to paginate through the results is to perform a search request with all the `REQUIRED` header/query parameters as described in the sections below (but without `searchRequestId`), then pass the `searchRequestId` returned in each response to the next request, until no more documents are returned. Note that it's often the case, but not guaranteed, that the `searchRequestId` remains stable through the entire pagination, so always use the `searchRequestId` from the most current response to make your next request.

## Method & HTTP target resource

GET `/api/public/export/report/{report-ID}/result/json`

Where `report-ID` is the ID of the report you wish to export.

## Request headers

The following request headers have to be provided with every data export request:

| Header        | Constraints | Value                                             |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | REQUIRED    | [Authorization](../optimize-api-authorization.md) |

## Query parameters

The following query parameters have to be provided with every data export request:

| Parameter         | Constraints | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| limit             | REQUIRED    | Maximum number of records per page. Please note that the limit will only be considered when performing the request for the first page of a raw data report. The following requests for a given searchRequestId will have the same page size as the first request.  |
| paginationTimeout | REQUIRED    | The amount of time (in seconds) for which a search context will be held in memory, so that the remaining pages of the result can be retrieved. For more information on how to paginate through the results, please refer to the section [Pagination](#pagination). |
| searchRequestId   | Optional    | The ID of a previous search for which you wish to retrieve the next page of results. For more information on how to get and use a searchRequestId please refer to the section [Pagination](#pagination).                                                           |
