This is a community offering. For our officially-supported offering, review Camunda's [Spring Zeebe SDK](/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started.md) to leverage Zeebe APIs ([gRPC](docs/apis-tools/zeebe-api/grpc.md) and [REST](/apis-tools/zeebe-api-rest/zeebe-api-rest-overview.md)) in your Spring Boot project.
:::

The Spring integration is a community extension that allows you to easily leverage Zeebe within your Spring or Spring Boot environment.

Essentially, Spring provides a wrapper around the [Zeebe Java Client](/apis-tools/java-client/index.md).
