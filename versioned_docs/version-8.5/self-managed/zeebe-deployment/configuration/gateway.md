The Zeebe Gateway can be configured similarly to the broker via the `application.yaml` file or environment variables. A complete gateway configuration template is available in the [Zeebe repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/main/dist/src/main/config/gateway.yaml.template).

:::info Configure an embedded gateway
If you're configuring a gateway that is embedded inside a broker (i.e. you've set [`zeebe.broker.gateway.enable`](./broker.md#zeebebrokergateway)), then you must use `zeebe.broker.gateway.*` instead of `zeebe.gateway.*` for any of the configuration options below. For environment variables this means you must use `ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_*` instead of `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_*`.
:::

## Conventions

Take the following conventions into consideration when working with the gateway configuration.

### Byte sizes

Buffers and data values referencing sizing must be specified as strings and follow the following format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes. If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.

For example, `sendBufferSize = "16MB"` creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes.

### Time units

Timeouts and intervals must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used by `java.time.Duration`, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:

- V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
- U is the unit, one of: ms = Milliseconds, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours

### Paths

Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the broker.

## Configuration

We provide tables with environment variables, application properties, a description, and corresponding default values in the following sections. We also describe a few use cases for each type of configuration.

Configuration names are noted as the **header** of each documented section, while the **field** values represent properties to set the configuration.

For deploying purposes, it is easier to use environment variables. The following sections outline usage of these variables. As Helm is the recommended way to deploy Camunda 8, we will explain some configuration options here as well. Find more information about possible Zeebe Gateway Helm chart [configurations](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/camunda/camunda-platform#zeebe-gateway-parameters).

:::note
The Zeebe Gateway is a Spring Boot application. As such, [many common Spring Boot properties will work out of the box](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html).

Additionally, its REST server is a reactive Spring Boot server (powered by WebFlux), and can be configured using the standard `server.*` properties, as well as the usual WebFlux properties. Its management server (for example, where actuator endpoints live) is configured as a child application context, and is also a reactive WebFlux server. It can be configured via `management.server.*` properties.

### server

The `server` configuration allows you to configure the main REST server. Below are a few common ones, but you can find a more exhaustive list [in the official Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#appendix.application-properties.server).

### zeebe.gateway.cluster

As mentioned, the gateway needs to connect to the Zeebe brokers.

It is important to configure the cluster's initial contact point to the Zeebe brokers. You may set only one of the Zeebe brokers, but keep in mind that resiliency will be lower than using all the Zeebe brokers available. The corresponding environment variable is called `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS`.

It is necessary to use the same cluster name for the broker and gateway. Otherwise, a connection will not be possible. The related configuration property is `zeebe.gateway.cluster.clusterName` and as an environment variable, it is called `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_CLUSTERNAME`.

If you use the Helm charts, both properties are configured for you already.

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Example value                              |

### zeebe.gateway.cluster.membership

To configure how the gateway connects and distributes information with other nodes (brokers or gateways) via SWIM, the following properties can be used. It might be useful to increase timeouts for setups that encounter a high latency between nodes.

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example value |

### zeebe.gateway.cluster.messageCompression

To configure the compression algorithm for all messages sent between the gateway and
the brokers, the following property can be set. Available options are NONE, GZIP, and SNAPPY.
This feature is useful when the network latency between the nodes is very high (for example, when nodes are deployed in different data centers).

When latency is high, the network bandwidth is severely reduced. Therefore, enabling compression helps improve the throughput. You need to decide between reducing bandwidth or reducing resources required for compression.

:::caution
When this flag is enabled, you must also enable compression in the standalone broker configuration. When there is no latency enabling, this may have a performance impact.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example value |

#### YAML snippet

```yaml

```

### zeebe.gateway.threads

To handle many concurrent incoming requests, the user can do two things: scale the deployed gateways (if the standalone mode is in use), or increase the used resources and threads.

The Zeebe Gateway uses one thread by default, but this should be set to a higher number if the gateway doesn’t exhaust its available resources and doesn’t keep up with the load. The corresponding environment variables look like this: `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_THREADS_MANAGEMENTTHREADS`.
During benchmarking and when increasing the thread count, it may also make sense to increase the given resources, which are quite small in the Helm chart.

For high availability and redundancy, two Zeebe Gateways are deployed by default with the Helm charts. To change that amount, set `zeebe-gateway.replicas=2` to a different number. Increasing the number of gateway replicas to more than one enables the possibility for quick failover; in the case one gateway dies, the remaining gateway(s) can handle the traffic.

To explore how the gateway behaves, or what it does, metrics can be consumed. By default, the gateway exports Prometheus metrics, which can be scrapped under `:9600/actuator/prometheus`.

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example value |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| managementThreads | Sets the number of threads the gateway will use to communicate with the broker cluster. This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_THREADS_MANAGEMENTTHREADS`. | 1             |

#### YAML snippet

```yaml

### zeebe.gateway.multiTenancy

Multi-tenancy in Zeebe can be configured with the following configuration properties.
Multi-tenancy is disabled by default.
Read more [in the multi-tenancy documentation](../../../self-managed/concepts/multi-tenancy.md).

:::note
For now, multi-tenancy is only supported in combination with Identity.
To use multi-tenancy, you must set [`authentication.mode`](#zeebegatewayclustersecurityauthentication) to `'identity'` and specify the
`camunda.identity.baseUrl` property or the [corresponding Camunda Identity environment variable](../../identity/deployment/configuration-variables.md#core-configuration)
as well.
:::

:::note
If you are using an embedded gateway, refer to the [broker configuration guide](./broker.md#multitenancy-configuration).
