At Camunda, we strive to offer excellent user experience at a high and stable level. On a strict opt-in basis, we are looking to collect environment and usage data to further improve the user experience for you. These insights help us to understand typical environment setups and product usage patterns and will be used to inform product improvement decisions to your benefit.

The telemetry reporting is disabled by default and only collects and sends data after you explicitly enable the telemetry configuration flag. The configuration can be changed by `superusers` at any time during runtime via a configuration menu option in the UI.

The collected data will be sent once every 24 hours via HTTPS, and it is ensured that the performance of Optimize will not be negatively affected by the reporting, even if the telemetry reporter faces unexpected errors. Furthermore, no data will be collected and sent when you stop Optimize.

## Collected data

Below you find the full list of data we want to collect, followed by a real-world example. On a conceptual level, they can be categorized into general data and meta/environment data.

### General data

The general data category contains information about your Optimize installation:

| Item            | Explanation                                                          |

| Product edition | The edition of the product (i.e. "enterprise")                       |

### Meta/environment data

The meta/environment data category contains information about the environmental setup:

## How to enable telemetry

### Optimize configuration

You can enable telemetry before starting Optimize by setting the `initializeTelemetry` flag in your configuration file to `true`. Refer to the [configuration section](./system-configuration.md#telemetry-configuration) for more details.

### UI

Once Optimize is running, telemetry can be enabled (or disabled) via a modal accessible from the user menu. Only superusers are authorized to access this menu and alter the telemetry configuration.

## Legal note

Before you install Camunda Optimize version â‰¥ 3.2.0 or activate the telemetric functionality, please make sure that you are authorized to take this step, and that the installation or activation of the telemetric functionality is not in conflict with any internal company policies, compliance guidelines, any contractual or other provisions or obligations of your company.

Camunda cannot be held responsible in the event of unauthorized installation or activation of this function.
