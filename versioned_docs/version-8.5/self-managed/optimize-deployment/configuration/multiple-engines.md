Learn how to set up multiple process engines with Optimize and which scenarios are supported.

## Possible multiple process engine scenarios

There are two possible setups where multiple process engines can be used:

- [Possible multiple process engine scenarios](#possible-multiple-process-engine-scenarios)
  - [Multiple engines with distributed databases](#multiple-engines-with-distributed-databases)
  - [Multiple engines with a shared database](#multiple-engines-with-a-shared-database)
- [Authentication and authorization in the multiple engine setup](#authentication-and-authorization-in-the-multiple-engine-setup)

Check which scenario corresponds to your setup because the configuration of multiple engines to Optimize is not always suited for the best import performance.

:::note Heads Up!

There are two restrictions for the multiple engines feature:

1. The process engines are assumed to have distinct process definitions, which means that one process definition (same key, tenant and version) is not deployed on two or more engines at the same time.
   Alternatively, each engine could be configured with default tenant identifiers as described in the [One Tenant Per Engine Scenario](../multi-tenancy/#one-process-engine-per-tenant).
2. The engines are assumed to have distinct tenant identifiers, which means one particular tenantId is not deployed on two or more engines at the same time.

### Multiple engines with distributed databases

In this scenario, you have multiple process engines and each engine has its own database as illustrated in the following diagram:

![Clustered Engine with distributed Database](img/Clustered-Engine-Distributed-Database.png)

Now, you are able to connect each engine to Optimize. The data will then automatically be imported into Optimize. The following diagram depicts the setup:

![Multiple Engines connected to Optimize, each having its own Database](img/Multiple-Engine-Distributed-Database.png)

To set up the connections to the engines, you need to add the information to the [configuration file](./system-configuration-platform-7.md). For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have two microservices, `Payment` and `Inventory`, each having their own engine with its own database and processes. Both are accessible in the local network. The `Payment` engine has the port `8080` and the `Inventory` engine the port `1234`. Now an excerpt of the configuration could look as follows:

```yaml
engines:
  payment:
    name: default
    rest: http://localhost:8080/engine-rest
    authentication:
      enabled: false
      password: ""
      user: ""
    enabled: true
  inventory:
    name: default
    rest: http://localhost:1234/engine-rest
    authentication:
      enabled: false
      password: ""
      user: ""
    enabled: true
```

`payment` and `inventory` are custom names that were chosen to distinguish where the data was originally imported from later on.

### Multiple engines with a shared database

In this scenario you have multiple engines distributed in a cluster, where each engine instance is connected to a shared database. See the following diagram for an illustration:

![Clustered Engine with shared Database](img/Clustered-Engine-Shared-Database.png)

Now it could be possible to connect each engine to Optimize. Since every engine accesses the same data through the shared database, Optimize would import the engine data multiple times. There is also no guarantee that importing the same data multiple times will not cause any data corruption. For this reason we do not recommend using the setup from [multiple engines with distributed databases](#multiple-engines-with-distributed-databases).

In the scenario of multiple engines with a shared database, it might make sense to balance the work load on each engine during the import. You can place a load balancer between the engines and Optimize, which ensures that the data is imported only once and the load is distributed among all engines. Thus, Optimize would only communicate to the load balancer. The following diagram depicts the described setup:

![Multiple Engines with shared Database connected to Optimize](img/Multiple-Engine-Shared-Database.png)

In general, tests have shown that Optimize puts a very low strain on the engine and its impact on the engine's operations are in almost all cases neglectable.

## Authentication and authorization in the multiple engine setup

When you configure multiple engines in Optimize, each process engine can host different users with a different set of authorizations. If a user is logging in, Optimize will try to authenticate and authorize the user on each configured engine. In case you are not familiar with how
the authorization/authentication works for a single engine scenario, visit the [User Access Management](./user-management.md) and [Authorization Management](#) documentation first.

To determine if a user is allowed to log in and which resources they are allowed to access within the multiple engine scenario, Optimize uses the following algorithm:

_Given the user X logs into Optimize, go through the list of configured engines and try to authenticate the user X, for each successful authentication fetch the permissions of X for applications and process definitions from that engine and allow X to access Optimize if authorized by at least one engine._

To give you a better understanding of how that works, let's take the following multiple engine scenario:

```
- Engine `payment`:
  - User without Optimize Application Authorization: Scooter, Walter
  - User with Optimize Application Authorization: Gonzo
  - Authorized Definitions for Gonzo, Scooter, Walter: Payment Processing

- Engine `inventory`:
  - User with Optimize Application Authorization: Piggy, Scooter
  - Authorized Definitions for Piggy, Scooter: Inventory Checkout

- Engine `order`:
  - User with Optimize Application Authorization: Gonzo
  - Authorized Definitions for Gonzo: Order Handling

```

Here are some examples that might help you to understand the authentication/authorization procedure:

- If `Piggy` logged in to Optimize, she would be granted access to Optimize and can create reports for the definition `Inventory Checkout`.
- If `Rizzo` logged in to Optimize, he would be rejected because the user `Rizzo` is not known to any engine.
- If `Walter` logged in to Optimize, he would be rejected despite being authorized to access the definition `Payment Processing` on engine `payment` because `Walter` does not have the `Optimize Application Authorization` required to access Optimize.
- If `Scooter` logged in to Optimize, he would be granted access to Optimize and can create reports for the definition `Inventory Checkout`. He wouldn't
  get permissions for the `Payment Processining` or the `Order Handling` definition, since he doesn't have Optimize permissions on the `payment` or `order` engine.
- If `Gonzo` logged in to Optimize, he would be granted access to Optimize and can create reports for the definition `Payment Processining` as well as the `Order Handling` definition, since definitions authorizations are loaded from all engines the user could be authenticated with (in particular `payment` and `order`).
