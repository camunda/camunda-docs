:::note Heads Up!
To update Optimize to version 3.4.0, perform the following steps first: [Migration & Update Instructions](./instructions.md).

:::

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in the supported environments
- Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

## Known issues

When updating Optimize, certain features might not work out of the box for the old data. This is because old versions of Optimize
do not fetch data that is necessary for the new feature to work. For this update, the following features do not work on the old data:

- [Process instance parts](components/userguide/process-analysis/report-analysis/process-instance-parts.md)
- [Canceled instances only filter](components/userguide/process-analysis/instance-state-filters.md#canceled-instances-only-filter)

To enable this feature for your old data, follow the steps in the [engine data reimport guide](./../reimport.md).
