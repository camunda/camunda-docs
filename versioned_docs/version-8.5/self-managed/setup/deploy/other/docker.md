:::danger
While the Docker images themselves are supported for production usage, [Docker Compose](/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/docker-compose.md) files are designed to be used by developers to run an environment locally; they are not designed to be used in production. We recommend to use [Kubernetes](/self-managed/setup/install.md) in production.
:::

We provide Docker images [via Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/camunda). All these images are publicly accessible (except for [Web Modeler](#web-modeler)).

:::info
The provided Docker images are supported for production usage only on Linux systems. Windows or macOS are only supported for development environments.

Zeebe is the only component that is often run on its own as a standalone component. In this scenario, it does not need anything else, so a simple `docker run` is sufficient:

```shell
docker run --name zeebe -p 26500-26502:26500-26502 camunda/zeebe:latest
```

This will give you a single broker node with the following ports exposed:

- `8080`: Gateway REST API (this is one of the ports clients need to use)
- `26500`: Gateway gRPC API (this is one of the ports clients need to use)
- `26501`: Command API (internal, gateway-to-broker)
- `26502`: Internal API (internal, broker-to-broker)

### Multi-platform support

With the Camunda 8.2.0 release and onward, all Camunda 8 Docker images are provided as multi-platform images. Your Docker client should automatically pull the image that suits your platform.

Use `linux/amd64` for your production environment. The `linux/arm64` image is provided for development purposes.

:::note
For Web Modeler, we only provide multi-platform images from the following releases onward: 8.2.8, 8.3.1, 8.4.0-alpha1.
:::

### Web Modeler

:::note
Web Modeler Self-Managed is available to [enterprise customers](/reference/licenses.md#web-modeler) only.
:::

The Docker images for Web Modeler are not publicly accessible, but available to enterprise customers only from
Camunda's private Docker registry.

| Web Modeler Component | Docker image                                                      |
| --------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend (`restapi`)   | `registry.camunda.cloud/web-modeler-ee/modeler-restapi:latest`    |
| Frontend (`webapp`)   | `registry.camunda.cloud/web-modeler-ee/modeler-webapp:latest`     |
| WebSocket server      | `registry.camunda.cloud/web-modeler-ee/modeler-websockets:latest` |

To pull the images you first need to log in using the credentials you received from Camunda:

```shell
$ docker login registry.camunda.cloud
Username: your_username
Password: ******
Login Succeeded
```

You can also find more information on the supported [configuration variables](/self-managed/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md).

## Configuration hints

### Zeebe

#### Volumes

The default data volume is under `/usr/local/zeebe/data`. It contains
all data which should be persisted.

#### Configuration

The Zeebe configuration is located at `/usr/local/zeebe/config/application.yaml`.
The logging configuration is located at `/usr/local/zeebe/config/log4j2.xml`.

The configuration of the Docker image can also be changed using [environment
variables](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/environment-variables.md). The configuration template file also contains information on the environment
variables to use for each configuration setting.

Available environment variables:

- `ZEEBE_LOG_LEVEL` - Sets the log level of the Zeebe Logger (default: `info`).
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_HOST` - Sets the host address to bind to instead of the IP of the container.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS` - Sets the contact points of other brokers in a cluster setup.

### Optimize

Some configuration properties are optional and have default values. See a description of these properties and their default values in the table below:

:::note
OpenSearch support in Optimize is limited to data import and the raw data report. The remaining functionality will be delivered with upcoming patches.
:::

Like for example this `docker-compose` configuration:

```
optimize:
    container_name: optimize
    image: camunda/optimize:8-latest
    ports:
        - 8090:8090
    environment:
        - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ccsm
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_ISSUER_URL=http://localhost:9090
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_ISSUER_BACKEND_URL=http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/camunda-platform
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_CLIENTID=optimize
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_CLIENTSECRET=secret
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE=optimize-api
        - OPTIMIZE_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
        - OPTIMIZE_ELASTICSEARCH_HTTP_PORT=9200
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_SECURITY_AUTH_COOKIE_SAME_SITE_ENABLED=false
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_ENTERPRISE=false
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_ZEEBE_ENABLED=true
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_ZEEBE_NAME=zeebe-record
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_ZEEBE_PARTITION_COUNT=1
        - CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_SHARING_ENABLED=true
        - SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_JWK_SET_URI=https://weblogin.cloud.company.com/.well-known/jwks.json
        - OPTIMIZE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=secret
```

Self-Managed Optimize must be able to connect to the configured database to write and read data. In addition, Optimize needs to connect to Identity for authentication purposes. Both of these requirements can be configured with the options described above.

Optimize must also be configured as a client in Identity, and users will only be granted access to Optimize if they have a role
that has `write:*` permission for Optimize.

For Optimize to import Zeebe data, Optimize must also be configured to be aware of the record prefix used when the records are exported to the database. This can also be configured per the example above.

### Connectors

Use the provided [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) files to execute all [out-of-the-box Connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md) automatically.
This uses the [Connectors Bundle](https://hub.docker.com/r/camunda/connectors-bundle) Docker image.

Note that some out-of-the-box Connectors are licensed under the
[Camunda Self-Managed Free Edition license](https://camunda.com/legal/terms/cloud-terms-and-conditions/camunda-cloud-self-managed-free-edition-terms/).
Find an overview in the [Connectors Bundle project](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle).

Refer to the [Connector installation guide](/self-managed/connectors-deployment/install-and-start.md) for details on how to provide the Connector templates for modeling.

#### Running single Connectors container

```shell
docker run --rm --name=MyConnectorsInstance \
  --network=camunda-platform_camunda-platform \
  -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_BROKER_GATEWAY-ADDRESS=zeebe:26500 \
  -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECURITY_PLAINTEXT=true \
  -e CAMUNDA_CONNECTOR_POLLING_ENABLED=false \
  -e CAMUNDA_CONNECTOR_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=false \
  -e OPERATE_CLIENT_ENABLED=false \
    camunda/connectors-bundle:latest
```

#### Custom set of Connectors

To add custom Connectors, you can build on top of our [Connectors base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/camunda/connectors/) that includes the pre-packaged runtime environment without any Connector.
To use the image, at least one Connector must be added to the `classpath`. We recommend providing JARs with all dependencies bundled.

:::caution

As all Connectors share a single `classpath`, different versions of the same dependency can be available and cause conflicts.
To prevent this, common dependencies like `jackson` can be shaded and relocated inside the Connector's JAR.

:::

You can add a Connector JAR by extending the base image with a JAR from a public URL:

```yml
FROM camunda/connectors:x.y.z

ADD https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/camunda/connector/connector-http-json/x.y.z/connector-http-json-0..0-with-dependencies.jar /opt/app/
```

You can also add a Connector JAR using volumes:

```shell
docker run --rm --name=connectors -d -v $PWD/connector.jar:/opt/app/ camunda/connectors:x.y.z
```
