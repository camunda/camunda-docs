Update guides lead you through the process for updating your Camunda 8 application or server installation version.

## Update procedure

You **must** use the following procedure when updating from one minor version to the next:

1. Update to the latest available patch version of the minor you are currently using. For example, if you are on `8.5.1`, update to `8.5.10`, where `10` is the latest available patch.

2. Update to the latest patch version of the following minor. For example, if you are on `8.5.10`, update to `8.6.5`, where `8.6.5` is the latest available `8.6.x` version.

3. **Never skip a minor version**. For example, never update directly from `8.5.x` to `8.7.x`, skipping `8.6.x`.

See the dedicated update guides below for detailed version update instructions.

:::note
Depending on your amount of data, run a minor version for at least 24 hours before updating to the next version.
