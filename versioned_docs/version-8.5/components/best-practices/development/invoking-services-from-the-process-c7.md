:::caution Camunda 7 only
This best practice targets Camunda 7.x only! If you are using Camunda 8, visit [connecting the workflow engine with your world](../connecting-the-workflow-engine-with-your-world/).
:::

Access business logic implemented for the Java VM and remote services by means of small pieces of glue code. This glue code maps process input/output to your business logic by means of best-of-breed libraries of your own choosing.

In most cases, you should use a pull approach, where external worker threads query Camunda for **external tasks**. Sometimes, you might also attach **JavaDelegates** to your model, and in case you need to define totally self-contained BPMN process definitions, you may want to leverage scripts or expressions for small pieces of logic.

## Understanding the possibilities

### Push and pull

There are two patterns available to glue your code to a process model:

- **Push:** The process engine actively issues a **service call** (or executes a **script**) via the mechanisms described below. The workflow engine pushes the work.
- **Pull:** External worker threads query the process engine API for **external tasks**, and they pull the work. Then, they do the actual work and notify the process engine of works completion.

### External tasks

An **external task** is a task that waits to be completed by some external service worker without explicitly calling that service. It's configured by declaring a **topic** (which characterizes the type of the service). The Camunda API must be polled to retrieve open external tasks for a certain service's topic and must be informed about the completion of a task:

![External task pattern](invoking-services-from-the-process-assets/external-task-pattern.png)

The interaction with the external task API can be done in two different ways:

- Use [Camunda's external task client libraries](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/ext-client/) for [Java](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-java) or [Node.js](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-js). These libraries make it very easy to implement your external task worker.

- Create your own client for Camunda's REST API based on the [Camunda OpenAPI specification](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/openapi/), probably via code generation. This approach allows you to generate code for every programming language and also covers the full REST API, not only external tasks.

Using external tasks comes with the following advantages:

- **Temporal decoupling**: The pattern can replace a message queue between the service task (the "consumer") and the service implementation (the "provider"). It can eliminate the need for operating a dedicated message bus while keeping the decoupling that messaging would provide.

- **Poyglot architectures**: The pattern can be used to integrate .NET based services, for example, when it might not be that easy to write Java delegates to call them. Service implementations are possible in any language that can be used to interact with a REST API.

- **Better scaling**: The pattern allows you to start and stop workers as you like, and run as many of them as you need. By doing so, you can scale each service task (or to be precise, each "topic") individually.

- **Connect cloud and on-premises**: The pattern supports you in running Camunda somewhere in the cloud (as our customers often do), because you can still have services on-premises, as they can now query their work via REST over SSL, which is also quite firewall-friendly.

- **Avoid timeouts**: The pattern allows you to asynchronously call long-running services, which eventually block for hours (and would therefore cause transaction and connection timeouts when being called synchronously).

- **Run services on specialized hardware**: Each worker can run in the environment that is best suited for the specific task of that worker; for example, CPU-optimized cloud instances for complex image processing and memory-optimized instances for other tasks.

Learn more about external tasks in the [use guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/) as well as the [reference](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/tasks/service-task/#external-tasks) and explore the video processing example shown above in greater detail by reading the [blog post](https://blog.camunda.org/post/2015/11/external-tasks/) about it.

:::note
Camunda 8 focuses on the external task pattern, there are no Java delegates available as explained in [this blog post](https://blog.bernd-ruecker.com/how-to-write-glue-code-without-java-delegates-in-camunda-cloud-9ec0495d2ba5).
:::

### Java delegates

A Java delegate is a simple Java class that implements the Camunda `JavaDelegate` interface. It allows you to use **dependency injection** as long as it is constructed as a Spring or CDI bean and connected to your BPMN `serviceTask` via the `camunda:delegateExpression` attribute:

```xml
<serviceTask id="service_task_publish_on_twitter" camunda:delegateExpression="#{tweetPublicationDelegate}" name="Publish on Twitter">
</serviceTask>
```

Leverage dependency injection to get access to your _business service_ beans from the delegate. Consider a delegate to be a semantical part of the process definition in a wider sense: it is taking care of the nuts and bolts needed to wire the business logic to your process. Typically, it does the following:

1. Data Input Mapping
2. Calling a method on the business service
3. Data Output Mapping

:::note
Avoid programming business logic into Java delegates. Separate this logic by calling one of your own classes as a business service, as shown below.
:::

```java
@Named
public class TweetPublicationDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

  @Inject
  private TweetPublicationService tweetPublicationService;

  public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    String tweet = new TwitterDemoProcessVariables(execution).getTweet(); // <1>
    // ...
    try {
      tweetPublicationService.tweet(tweet); // <2>
    } catch (DuplicateTweetException e) {
      throw new BpmnError("duplicateMessage"); // <3>
    }
  }
  //...
```

<span className="callout">1</span>

Retrieving the value of this process variable belongs to what we call the **input mapping** of the delegate code, and is therefore considered to be part of the wider process definition.

<span className="callout">2</span>

This method executes process engine-independent **business logic**. It is therefore not part of the wider process definition anymore and placed in a separate business service bean.

<span className="callout">3</span>

This exception is process engine-specific and therefore typically not produced by your business service method. It's part of the **output mapping** that we need to translate the business exception to the exception needed to drive the process - again code being part of the "wider" process definition and to be implemented in the Java delegate.

In case you want to create Java delegates that are **reusable** for other process definitions, leverage [field injection](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/delegation-code/#field-injection) to pass configuration from the BPMN process definition to your Java delegate.

One advantage of using Java delegates is that, if you develop in Java, this is a very simple way to write code and connect it with your process model, especially in embedded engine scenarios.

## Selecting the implementation approach

### General recommendation

In general, we _recommend to use external tasks_ to apply a general architecture and mindset, that allows to [leverage Camunda 8 easier](/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/migration-readiness.md#prepare-for-smooth-migrations). This typically outweighs the following downsides of external tasks:

- A slightly increased complexity for Java projects, because they have to handle separate Java clients.
- A slightly increased overhead compared to Java delegates, as all communication with the engine is remote, even if it runs in the same Java VM.

Only if the increased latency does not work for your use case, for example, because you need to execute a 30-task process synchronously to generate a REST response within a handful of milliseconds, should you then consider Java delegates (or also consider switching to use Camunda 8).

## Dealing with problems and exceptions

When invoking services, you can experience faults and exceptions. Refer to our separate best practices about:

- [Understanding Camunda 7 transaction handling](../understanding-transaction-handling-c7/)
- [Dealing with problems and exceptions](../dealing-with-problems-and-exceptions/).

## Example technology solutions

### Calling SOAP web services

When you need to call a SOAP web service, you will typically be given access to a machine-readable, WSDL-based description of the service. You can then use [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html) and (for example) Apache CXF's [JAX-WS client generation](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html) to generate a Java Web Service Client by making use of a Maven plugin. That client can be called from within your JavaDelegate.

Find a full example that uses JAX-WS client generation in the [Camunda examples repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/servicetask/soap-cxf-service).

We typically prefer the client code generation over using the [Camunda SOAP Connector](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/connectors/), because of the better IDE support to do the data mapping by using code completion. You also can leverage standard testing approaches and changes in the WSDL will re-trigger code-generation and your compiler will check for any problems that arise from a changed interface. However, if you need a self-contained BPMN XML without any additional Java code, the connector could be the way to go. Refer to [SOAP Connector example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/servicetask/soap-service).

### Calling REST web services

If you need to call a REST web service, you will typically be given access to a human-readable documentation of the service. You can use standard Java REST client libraries like [RestEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org) or [JAX-RS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giepu.html) to write a Java REST service client that can be called from within a JavaDelegate.

We typically prefer writing Java clients over the [Camunda REST Connector](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/connectors/), because of the better IDE support to do the data mapping by using code completion. This way, you also can leverage standard testing approaches. However, if you need a self-contained BPMN XML without any additional Java code, the Connector could be the way to go. Refer to the [REST Connector example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/servicetask/rest-service).

### Sending JMS messages

When you need to send a JMS message, use a plain Java Client and invoke it from a service task in your process; for example, by using a Camunda Java delegate:

```java
@Named("jmsSender")
public class SendJmsMessageDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

  @Resource(mappedName = "java:/queue/order")
  private Queue queue;

  @Resource(mappedName = "java:/JmsXA")
  private QueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

  public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    String correlationId = UUID.randomUUID().toString(); // <1>
    execution.setVariable("jmsCorrelationId", correlationId);

    Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection(); // <2>
    Session session = connection.createSession(true, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
    MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);

    TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage( // <3>
      "someOwnContent, e.g. Tweet Object Data, plus " + correlationId); // <4>
    producer.send(message);

    producer.close();
    session.close();
    connection.close();
  }

}
```

<span className="callout">1</span>

Consider what information you can use to correlate back an asynchronous response to your process instance. We typically prefer a generated, artificial UUID for communication, which the waiting process will also need to remember.

<span className="callout">2</span>

You will need to open and close JMS connections, sessions, and producers. Note that this example just serves to get you started. In real life, you will need to decide which connections you need to open, and of course, properly close.

<span className="callout">3</span>

You will need to create and send your specific message.

<span className="callout">4</span>

Add relevant business data to your message together with correlation information.

This example just serves to get you started. In real life, consider whether you need to encapsulate the JMS client in a separate class and just wire it from the Java delegate. Also decide which connections you need to open and close properly at which peristaltic points.

### Using SQL to access the database

Use plain JDBC if you have simple requirements. Invoke your SQL statement from a service task in your process; for example, by using a Camunda Java delegate:

```java
@Named("simpleSqlDelegate")
public class simpleSqlDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

  @Resource(name="customerDB")
  private javax.sql.DataSource customerDB;

  public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    Statement statement = null;
    Connection connection = null;

    try {
      connection = customerDB.getConnection();
      String query = "SELECT name " +  // <1>
                     "FROM customer " +
                     "WHERE id = ?";
      statement = connection.createStatement();
      statement.setString(1, execution.getProcessBusinessKey()); // <2>
      ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery(query);
      if (resultSet.next()) {
        execution.setVariable("customerName", resultSet.getString("name")); // <3>
      }
    } finally {
      if (statement != null) statement.close();
      if (connection != null) connection.close();
    }

}
```

<span className="callout">1</span>

You will need to define your SQL statement. Consider using prepared statements if you want to execute a statement object many times.

<span className="callout">2</span>

You will typically need to feed parameters into your SQL query that are already known during execution of the process instance...

<span className="callout">3</span>

...and deliver back a potential result that maybe needed later in the process.

Note that the Camunda process engine will have opened a database transaction for its own persistence purposes when calling the Java delegate shown above. You will need to make a conscious decision if you want to join that transaction (and set up your TX management accordingly).

Instead of invoking SQL directly, consider using [JPA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html) if you have more complex requirements. Its object/relational mapping techniques will allow you to bind database tables to Java objects and abstract from specific database vendors and their specific SQL dialects.

### Calling SAP systems

To call a **SAP** system, you have the following options:

- Use REST or SOAP client calls, connecting Camunda to **SAP Netweaver Gateway** or **SAP Enterprise Services**.

- Use **SAP's Java Connectors (JCo)**. Consider using some frameworks to make this easier, like the open source frameworks of [Hibersap](https://github.com/hibersap).

### Executing a Groovy script

A script task...

<img src="/img/bpmn-elements/task-script.svg" />

&nbsp;...is defined by specifying the script and the `scriptFormat`.

```xml
<scriptTask id='theScriptTask' scriptFormat='groovy' camunda:resultVariable="size">
  <script>anArray.size()</script>
</scriptTask>
```

For more extensive code (which should also be tested separately), consider using scripts external to your BPMN file and reference them with a `camunda:resource` attribute on the `scriptTask`.

Learn more about the many ways scripts can be used with Camunda from our [user guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/scripting/).
