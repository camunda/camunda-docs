**Subprocesses** are element containers that allow defining common functionality. For example, you can attach an event to a subprocess's border.

When the event is triggered, the subprocess is interrupted, regardless which of its elements is currently active.

Currently supported elements:

- [Embedded subprocess](embedded-subprocesses/embedded-subprocesses.md)
- [Call activities](call-activities/call-activities.md)
- [Event subprocess](event-subprocesses/event-subprocesses.md)
