The Micronaut integration is a community extension allowing you to leverage Zeebe within your Micronaut environment.

The integration provides a wrapper around the [Zeebe Java Client](/apis-tools/java-client/index.md), and is preconfigured with sensible defaults so you can get started with minimal configuration. Add a dependency, implement a worker, and add your credentials in your Micronaut project.

The Micronaut Framework is known for its efficient use of resources. Built-in images created with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) reduce startup times to milliseconds.
