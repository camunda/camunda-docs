Please refer to the [Installation Guide](/self-managed/platform-deployment/overview.md) for details on how to install Zeebe in a private cloud or on your own hardware.

Within this section you will find detailed information about:

- [Configuration](configuration/configuration.md) - Explains the configuration options. These configuration options apply to both environments, but not to Camunda 8. In Camunda 8, the configuration is provided for you.
- [Security](security/security.md) - Discusses the security aspects of running Zeebe and how to use them.
- [Operation](operations/zeebe-in-production.md) - Outlines topics that become relevant when you want to operate Zeebe in production.
