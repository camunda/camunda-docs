### Create an account

Fill out the form and submit, or sign up using the social sign up buttons like Google or GitHub.

If you fill out the form, you'll receive a confirmation email. Click on the link to verify your email address and set your password.

If you choose to create an account through the social sign up buttons, you'll be redirected to Console directly.

## Log in to your Camunda 8 account

Log in with the email address and password you used in the previous form, or use the social login buttons.
