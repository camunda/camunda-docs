# Release & publish procedure

The complete documentation is fully versioned. This means that there will be no static content that is the same across all versions. The documentation contains a drop down menu to set the version including `Next`, a version-less preview.

## Perform a patch release

Patch releases for docs can happen nearly any time, barring significant infrastructure changes. Currently, it's recommended to either ask for a release in #ask-documentation (internal Camunda employees only) or include a release date in the PR.

Issues or PRs labeled `Bug` will be prioritized and released as soon as possible, but may not be immediate.

To perform a patch release, confirm what is on `main` via staging at [stage.docs.camunda.io](https://stage.docs.camunda.io) is ready for release.

Then use the GitHub UI and follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/releases and click **Draft a new release**
2. Click **Choose a tag** and create a new tag representing the next patch release. The title with autopopulate.
3. Click **Autogenerate release notes**. The **Describe this release** field will fill with PRs included in this release.
4. Click **Publish release**.

The build process for [publish-prod](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/actions/workflows/publish-prod.yaml) will kick off which could take around 30 min to finish. If publish-prod is successful, the updates will appear on [docs.camunda.io](https://docs.camunda.io).

## Perform a minor release

Minor releases to Camunda 8 happen twice a year in April and October, on the second Tuesday of the month, and the documentation is versioned on the same cadence.

To prepare for a minor product release, you'll need to create a new docs version.

### Create new version

The versioning process copies a snapshot of the current documentation from the un-versioned source to a new versioned source location.

Because we are using [multiple Docusaurus docs instances](./versioning.md#instances-docs-vs-optimize), we technically create _two_ new versions at time of product release: one for the main documentation, and one for the Optimize documentation.

Docusaurus creates the new versions in `versioned_docs` and `optimize_versioned_docs`. The contents in `docs` and `optimize` immediately become the documentation for the _next_ release. See [the versioning docs](./versioning.md#structure) for more details on source locations of versions.

To create the new versions:

1. Make the `./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh` shell file executable, if it isn't already:

   ```bash
   > chmod +x ./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh
   ```

2. Update [the versions at the top of the `./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh` file](../hacks/cutNewVersions.sh#L4-L8).
3. Run the `./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh` script:

   ```bash
   > ./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh
   ```

4. Add a record correlating the two versions to [`src/versions.js`](../src/versions.js#L16-L30).

   The `versionMappings` variable maps Optimize versions to main docs versions:

   ```javascript
   const versionMappings = [
     // ðŸ‘‹ When cutting a new version, add a new mapping here!
     {
       docsVersion: "8.0",
       optimizeVersion: "3.8.0",
     },
     { docsVersion: "1.3", optimizeVersion: "3.7.0" },
   ];
   ```

   Caution: Order of the items in the array is important. Add the new mapping in the first position of the array, because the first item is treated as the "current" version mapping.

5. Ensure the "unmaintained" banner does not appear for supported versions. We currently support all versions of Camunda 8 since none are older than 18 months.

   ```javascript
   // ðŸ‘‹ When cutting a new version, remove the banner for maintained versions by adding an entry. Remove the entry to versions >18 months old.
      versions: {
         "8.0": {
            banner: "none",
         },
      },
   ```

6. Ensure the older docs do not appear in the sitemap. Only the unversioned links should appear in the sitemap.

   In docusaurus.config.js, add the previously current version number to the ignorePatterns array:

   ```javascript
   sitemap: {
      changefreq: "weekly",
      priority: 0.5,
      ignorePatterns: [
      "/docs/8.1/**",
      ],
   },
   ```

7. Manipulate version-wide redirects properly in `.htaccess`.

   - vNext should include a redirect from its numbered counterpart to /next.
   - The new vCurrent should include a redirect from its numbered counterpart to /.
   - The previous vCurrent should no longer include a redirect.

   This is a good candidate for future automation.

8. Create a PR containing only the first commit generated by the `./hacks/cutNewVersions.sh` script. This commit is very large, and will crash the browser of anyone trying to review it.

   Tip: Use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to create this PR, to avoid crashing your own browser. Example:

   ```sh
   gh pr create --assignee @me --title "release(8.6): release version 8.6 (the big PR)"
   ```

9. Create a second PR, into the first PR, with the rest of the changes. This PR will be much easier for users to review in the GitHub UI.

   Tip: Use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to create this PR also. Specify the `--base` option to target the first PR. Example:

   ```sh
   gh pr create --base "branch-name-of-the-first-PR" --assignee @me --title "release(8.6): release version 8.6 (the reviewable PR)"
   ```

10. With successful build and approval, merge the second PR into the first. Then merge the first into `main`.

### Release the new version

Use the GitHub UI and follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/releases and click **Draft a new release**
2. Click **Choose a tag** and create a new tag representing the minor release. The title with autopopulate.
3. Click **Autogenerate release notes**. The **Describe this release** field will fill with PRs included in this release.
4. Click **Publish release**.

The build process for [publish-prod](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/actions/workflows/publish-prod.yaml) will kick off which could take around 30 min to finish. If publish-prod is successful, the updates will appear on [docs.camunda.io](https://docs.camunda.io).

## Manually Trigger the Algolia crawler (DocSearch)

Search not working for a new minor version? A specific document, published recently, not showing up in the internal search results?

Our twice yearly minor releases usually line up nicely with the scheduled Algolia crawl - Tuesday early US morning.

If the minor version docs are deployed after Tuesday early US morning, the Algolia crawler should be manually triggered, or the internal search (DocSearch) will not work for the new minor version.

Patch releases with significant or urgent updates may also require a manually triggered crawler.

This requires [admin access](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/users/login). Contact @pepopowitz or @akeller for assistance.
