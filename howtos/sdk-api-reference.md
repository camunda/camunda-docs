# SDK API Reference Documentation

The docs include generated API reference documentation for the Camunda SDKs. Unlike the [interactive API explorers](./interactive-api-explorers.md) (which render an OpenAPI spec as a Swagger-style explorer), the SDK API references are generated from the SDK source code using language-specific documentation tools and synced into this repo as Markdown.

## Overview

| SDK | Source repo | Doc tool | Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | [orchestration-cluster-api-js](https://github.com/camunda/orchestration-cluster-api-js) | TypeDoc + typedoc-plugin-markdown | [sync-ts-sdk-docs.yaml](../.github/workflows/sync-ts-sdk-docs.yaml) |
| Python | [orchestration-cluster-api-python](https://github.com/camunda/orchestration-cluster-api-python) | Sphinx + sphinx-markdown-builder | [sync-python-sdk-docs.yaml](../.github/workflows/sync-python-sdk-docs.yaml) |

## How it works

Each SDK repo has its own doc generation pipeline that produces Markdown files compatible with Docusaurus. A GitHub Actions workflow in this repo (camunda-docs) checks out the SDK, generates the docs, copies them into the appropriate location, and opens a PR.

### Automatic synchronization (next version)

The sync workflows run on a weekly schedule (Thursdays at 4 PM UTC). They pull from the SDK's `main` branch and update the docs in the `docs/` directory (the "next" version).

If you've made changes to an SDK's `main` branch but do not require urgent documentation updates, wait for the scheduled workflow.

If you require urgent updates, trigger the workflow manually from the Actions tab with no `docs_version` input (or leave it empty).

### Updating a released version (backport)

To update the API reference for a released docs version (e.g. 8.8):

1. Go to the Actions tab and select the SDK sync workflow.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. Enter the version number in the `docs_version` field (e.g. `8.8`).
4. The workflow will:
   - Check out the SDK's `stable/8.8` branch.
   - Generate the docs.
   - Copy them into `versioned_docs/version-8.8/apis-tools/...` (not `docs/`).
   - Open a PR against `main`.

The PR branch is version-scoped (e.g. `update-ts-sdk-docs/8.8`), so a backport sync and a next-version sync can coexist without conflicts.

> **Note:** The `sdk_ref` input is available for advanced use (e.g. testing from a feature branch) but is ignored when `docs_version` is set, since the SDK branch is derived from the version (`stable/<version>`).

## Where the docs live

### Next version (`docs/`)

| SDK | Landing page | API reference |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | — (uses existing `typescript-sdk.md`) | `docs/apis-tools/typescript/api-reference/` |
| Python | `docs/apis-tools/python-sdk/python-sdk.md` | `docs/apis-tools/python-sdk/api-reference/` |

### Released versions (`versioned_docs/`)

Same paths, under `versioned_docs/version-X.Y/` instead of `docs/`.

## Sidebar configuration

The TypeScript SDK API reference uses a Docusaurus [autogenerated sidebar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated). This is configured in `sidebars.js` and relies on `_category_.json` files and `sidebar_position` frontmatter in the generated Markdown to control ordering.

The Python SDK API reference uses a manually-defined sidebar in `sidebars.js` (or a `sidebar.js` file in the `api-reference/` directory).

## Relationship to the REST API sync

The [REST API sync workflow](../.github/workflows/sync-rest-api-docs.yaml) documented in [interactive-api-explorers.md](./interactive-api-explorers.md) syncs the OpenAPI specification for the interactive API explorer. The SDK sync workflows documented here are separate — they sync generated SDK reference documentation (classes, methods, types) produced by the SDK repos.

## Adding a new SDK

To add a sync workflow for a new SDK:

1. Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/sync-<name>-sdk-docs.yaml` following the pattern of the existing workflows.
2. Add a sidebar entry in `sidebars.js` for the new SDK's docs location.
3. Ensure the SDK repo has a doc generation command that produces Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (with `mdx: { format: md }` frontmatter).
