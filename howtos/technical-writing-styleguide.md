# Camunda style guide

## Overview

The following document outlines Camunda’s writing techniques and practices to ensure uniform styling across Camunda documentation and to yield a more cohesive and organized user experience alongside a fast-growing staff.

**NOTE: This style guide combines the stylistic efforts of the corporate communications and DevRel teams at Camunda.**

## Application

The Camunda Style Guide applies primarily to the following:

- Camunda 7 & 8 documentation
- Emails
- Banners
- Web copy
- Blog copy
- Event-related copy
- Press releases
- Whitepapers
- Case studies

## Objectives

We encourage document authors and technical writers to keep in mind grammar, punctuation, formatting, and terminology to create user-friendly documentation between developers and users. With these tools in mind, our goal is to achieve four key objectives in our technical writing:

| Goal         | Questions to ask                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective    | Is there a clear objective, whether a learning objective or key takeaways? Are they summarized clearly in the intro and conclusion?             |
| Organization | Is the documentation organized? Is the flow of information logical? Have I broken large components into smaller, simpler components?            |
| Clarity      | Is the information clear? Have I spelled out acronyms and avoided too much company jargon or slang? Does the reader understand what I'm saying? |
| Direction    | Does the reader know what they need to do? Does the reader know where to turn if they don't know what to do?                                    |

**Note: We use the [AP Style Guide](https://writer.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-ap-style-of-writing/) in US English – this benchmark of international journalism standards is updated each year to reflect the constant evolution of the English language.**

## Grammar

| Avoid expressing a month as a number to avoid common confusion around US/EU conventions. If there is no way around it, use the US-English “/” as separators for all content (such as marketing materials) with the exception of technical documentation (guides, manuals, etc.)<br/>In technical documentation, use "-" as separators as it mirrors most timestamps in various programming languages. Also note that it may be best to remove the day of the week as it may not be as relevant as the day and month. | 10 December, 2018                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | December 10, 2018                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

See details in the sub-section titled "Oxford comma" below this table.<br/>Always use a comma to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven [coordinating conjunctions](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/coordinating-conjunctions/): and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet.<br/>Avoid using too many commas and initiating a [run-on sentence](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/independent_and_dependent_clauses/runonsentences.html), however. When possible, use short, separate sentences as opposed to several pieces of information in one sentence.<br/>Always use a comma to separate a sentence introduction from the remainder of the sentence content (Therefore, Thus, As a result, So, Henceforth,)<br/>In some specific cases, primarily on social media and where copy is exceptionally brief and clear, the Oxford comma is omitted. It should be used consistently in web and long-form content. | Camunda loves its products, GitHub and Google Analytics.<br/>We want to automate a process so let's start by creating an account with Camunda 8.<br/>Therefore we needed to wait for the program to load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Camunda loves its products, GitHub, and Google Analytics.<br/>We want to automate a process, so let's start by creating an account with Camunda 8.<br/>Therefore, we needed to wait for the program to load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Em dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/)       | —<br/>As you can see, em dashes are slightly longer than en dashes.<br/>On a Mac, execute Shift+Option+Minus (-); on Windows use Ctrl+Alt+Minus (-).<br/>The em dash is used to set apart additional, descriptive notes also defined as "parenthetical information," or information you might put inside parentheses.<br/>In many programs, you will be unable to create an em dash with a single line. In these instances, please use two hyphens (--) with no white space between to create an em dash.<br/>If you find yourself pondering if you're using this correctly, cover up the sentence you've written after the em dash. If the first sentence makes perfect sense without it, then you're onto a winner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | - –<br/>In the true spirit of the city Camunda was founded, Berlin, Germany, Camunda is a diverse, distributed and global organization with "Camundos" around the world.<br/>At Camunda, we have made it our mission to enable organizations to design, automate and improve these processes, no matter where they are and what they entail.<br/>Camunda was founded in 2008, at a time when established industry players were advocating a low-code approach, but we believed in a developer-first approach. | In the true spirit of the city Camunda was founded—that is, Berlin, Germany— Camunda is a diverse, distributed, and global organization with "Camundos" around the world.<br/>At Camunda, we have made it our mission to enable organizations to design, automate and improve these processes—no matter where they are and what they entail.<br/>Camunda was founded in 2008, at a time when established industry players were advocating a low-code approach—but we believed in a developer-first approach. |
| [En dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/dash/)                                  | –<br/>The en dash is shorter than an em dash, and is not the same as a hyphen.<br/>To type an en dash on your Mac, type Option+Minus (-). To type an en dash on Windows, hold down Alt and type 0150 on the numeric keyboard; the en dash will appear upon releasing the Alt key.<br/>The en dash should predominantly be used for date and time ranges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | -<br/>The scheduled window for the installation is 1-3pm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The scheduled window for the installation is 1–3 p.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [Prefixes](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/prefixes) | Prefixes are a stumbling block for many individuals with English as their first language. There's no right or wrong way to use them, because it genuinely depends on the dictionary you use, the style guide you follow, or just how confusing we want to make the language.<br/>Prefixes are basically a few letters tagged at the front of a word to create a different meaning.<br/>Ensure you omit the hyphen!<br/>If at any point you feel a word doesn't look quite right, just send DevRel a quick Slack, because, unfortunately, there are a ton of exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Un happy<br/>De activate<br/>Re-activate<br/>Un-do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Unhappy<br/>Deactivate<br/>Reactivate<br/>Undo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Oxford comma

- **Why we use it**: The Oxford comma is extremely helpful in developing a clear list of items or subjects. Take a look at the example below where we do not use an Oxford comma to separate all of the subjects:

  **"Camunda loves its products, GitHub and Google Analytics."**

In the example above, one might assume Camunda's products include GitHub and Google Analytics, when in fact, they are not Camunda products. Instead, you want to state that Camunda loves its products, Camunda loves GitHub, and Camunda loves Google Analytics.

To help clarify this statement, we need to separate all of the subjects by a comma so the reader understands exactly what we are trying to say.

**"Camunda loves its products, GitHub, and Google Analytics."**

- **Why it's preferred**: The Oxford comma is preferred because it erases potential confusion within a sentence or list. Take a look at the second example below:

  **"Rachel Ray finds inspiration in cooking her family and her dog."**

In the example above, one might assume Rachel Ray finds inspiration in cooking her family and cooking her dog, when in reality, Rachel Ray enjoys all three of these things separately (thankfully.) We should adjust the sentence to the following to increase clarity and decrease ambiguity:
**"Rachel Ray finds inspiration in cooking, her family, and her dog."**

## Formatting, organization and structure for conceptual pieces

The following table outlines best practices for conceptual pieces of information in the document. These pieces usually introduce the reader to a topic with a goal of teaching the reader about that topic before introducing further details or steps for implementation. (For example, an opening summary or overview of the document subject.)
| Subject | Practice| Avoid | Use |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Concise writing | One of the most important techniques in technical writing is keeping your text short, clear, clean, and concise.<br/>As a result, work to eliminate unnecessary words or phrases to reduce the amount of text the user must read.<br/>To help test how readable and user-friendly your text is, review these [readability metrics](https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/readability-metrics-and-technical-writing-b776422eaba) you can use.<br/>Review this additional [guide to Hemingway](https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/hemingway-app-for-technical-writing-f994c8b2412a), a great tool to test the readability and user experience of your document. | Camunda 8 is powered by Zeebe, a new class of BPMN workflow engine that delivers true horizontal scalability and enables high-performance use cases that were once beyond the realm of workflow automation.<br/>Camunda 8 is architected for the cloud from the ground up. It is ideal for cloud application use cases such as microservices-based applications and integrates seamlessly with best-in-class cloud components. | Camunda 8 is powered by Zeebe, a new class of BPMN workflow engine that delivers horizontal scalability and high-performance use cases for workflow automation.<br/>Ideal for microservice-based applications, Camunda 8 easily integrates with industry-leading cloud components. |
| Icons |
You may utilize `<MarkerGuideline.Invalid />` and `<MarkerGuideline.Invalid />` icons in the documentation for clarity. | N/A | N/A |
| Separated paragraphs | A user-friendly experience is a clean, concise one with as few words as possible.<br/>A user-friendly experience separates these chunks of information into separate sections for easy reading and organization.<br/>Avoid large, lengthy paragraphs. Instead, try to keep your paragraphs to a maximum of four or five sentences, and then begin a new paragraph introducing more information. | Message correlation is a powerful feature in Camunda 8. It allows you to target a running workflow with a state update from an external system asynchronously. This tutorial uses the Node.js client, but it serves to illustrate message correlation concepts that are applicable to all language clients. We will use Simple Monitor to inspect the running workflow state. Simple Monitor is a community-supported tool, and is not designed to be used in production - however, it is useful during development. | Message correlation is a powerful feature in Camunda 8.

| Short sentences | Avoid long, lengthy sentences and practice short, separate sentences when describing various processes and technologies. This will help the user take a step-by-step approach, piece by piece, through a larger conceptual item without getting lost or feeling overwhelmed. | At Camunda we have made it our mission to provide developers with the best experience because our platform and tools are easy to get started and use in your environment right away, with full public access to all our docs, open APIs to integrate with just about anything, and a vibrant community of 100,000 developers. | At Camunda we have made it our mission to provide developers with the best experience.

| That | Avoid overuse of the term "that." More often than not, the term is repetitive or unnecessary.<br/>To practice, double check your sentences by typing Ctrl+F and searching the term "that." Read your sentences without the term to see if the sentences still make sense. If they do, chances are you can remove the term.<br/>Typically, you can remove "that" before most nouns, though you may want to keep "that" before an adjective. | To confirm that the first gateway works correctly, complete the steps below: | To confirm the first gateway works correctly, complete the steps below: |
| Titles, headers, and sidebars | Sentence case spelling in titles and headers.<br/>For sentence case spelling, only capitalize the first word and any proper nouns.<br/>Ensure titles and headers are descriptive enough so Camunda doesn't have a large surplus of mere "Overview" pages.<br/>In Markdown, do not include a colon in your headers.<br/>Note that for clean, short sidebar labels, you may remove excess wording that would usually align with the style guide. | How To Open A File<br/>Our travel guide to berlin, germany<br/>Camunda 8 overview<br/>Readiness probe as yaml config:<br/>Process instance modification | How to open a file<br/>Our travel guide to Berlin, Germany<br/>What is Camunda 8?<br/>Readiness probe as yaml config<br/>Modifying process instances |
| Whether or not | "Whether X produces the expected value or not" can seem a bit repetitive.<br/>In most cases, it is appropriate to remove the "or not" at the end of the sentence to avoid repetition and unnecessary text.<br/>In a picturesque world, we should lean on "If X produces the expected value," entirely eliminating the need to use the "whether or not" terminology. | This specifies whether host language resources like classes and their methods are accessible or not. | This specifies if host language resources like classes and their methods are accessible. |

### Titles and headers (sentence case):

- **Why we use it**: Camunda uses sentence case spelling in titles and headers within technical documentation because this format is more synchronous with the way and flow of human speaking and writing, allowing a more modern and user-friendly approach to the document.
- **Why it's preferred**: On top of its modern structure, sentence case titles and headers tend to read more clear, clean, and neat on the page. While title case is great for printed newspapers and magazines, sentence case tends to read more friendly on the web in a conversational style. See a few of our examples below:

  **"Setting up your first development project"**
  **"Monitor your process in Operate"**
  **"Getting started with Camunda 8"**

### Numerical lists/steps:

- **Why we use them**: Many users do not enjoy reading long sentences or paragraphs because they can get lost in a lengthy series of information and actions. Instead, Camunda utilizes a series of steps to break each concept and/or action into its own numerical line. This way, the user can more easily follow along with the process.
- **Why they're preferred**: Steps allow step-by-step guidance so the reader can more easily track their progress or a particular place where they may get stuck/pause. See an example of this transformation below for added clarity:
