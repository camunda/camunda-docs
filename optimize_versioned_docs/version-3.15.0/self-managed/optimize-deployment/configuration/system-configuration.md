description: "An overview of all possible configuration options in Optimize."
---

All distributions of Camunda Optimize come with a predefined set of configuration options that can be overwritten by the user, based on current environment requirements. To do that, have a look into the folder named `config` which contains a file called `environment-config.yaml` with values that override the default Optimize properties.

You can see a sample configuration file with all possible configuration fields
and their default values [here](service-config.yaml).

In the following section, you will find descriptions and default values of the configuration fields with their respective YAML path.

:::note Heads Up
For changes in the configuration to take effect, you need to restart Optimize!
:::

### Java system properties & OS environment variable placeholders

To externalize configuration properties from the `environment-config.yaml`, Optimize provides variable placeholder support.

The order in which placeholders are resolved is the following:

1. Java system properties
2. OS environment variables

The placeholder format is `${VARIABLE_NAME}` and allows you to refer to a value of a Java system property or OS environment variable of your choice.
The `VARIABLE_NAME` is required to contain only lowercase or uppercase letters, digits and underscore `_` characters and shall not begin with a digit. The corresponding regular expression is `([a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*)`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET}
```

Given this variable is set before Optimize is started, for example on Unix systems with:

```
export AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=sampleTokenValue
```

The value will be resolved at startup to `sampleTokenValue`.

However, if the same variable is provided at the same time as a Java system property, for example via passing `-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue` to the Optimize startup script:

```
./optimize-startup.sh -DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue
```

The value would be resolved to `othertokenValue` as Java system properties have precedence over OS environment variables.

:::note
For Windows users, to pass Java system properties to the provided Windows Batch script `optimize-startup.bat`, you have to put them into double quotes when using the `cmd.exe` shell, as shown below.
:::

```
optimize-startup.bat "-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"
```

For the Windows Powershell in three double quotes:

```
./optimize-startup.bat """-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"""
```

#### Default values

For variable placeholders it's also possible to provide default values using the following format: `${VARIABLE_NAME:DEFAULT_VALUE}`. The `DEFAULT_VALUE` can contain any character except `}`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET:defaultSecret}
```

### Security

These values control mechanisms of Optimize related security, e.g. security headers and authentication.

### Public API

This section focuses on common properties related to the Public REST API of Optimize. It is
mandatory to configure one of the values below if the Public REST API is to be used. If neither is
configured an error will be thrown and all requests to the Public API will get rejected. If both are configured then
the `jwtSetUri` will take precedence and the `accessToken` will be ignored.

| YAML path       | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api.accessToken | null          | Secret static shared token to be provided to the secured REST API in the authorization header. Will be ignored if `api.jwtSetUri` is also set. |
| api.jwtSetUri   | null          | Complete URI to get public keys for JWT validation, e.g. `https://weblogin.cloud.company.com/.well-known/jwks.json`                            |
| api.audience    | optimize      | Optimize tries to match this with the `aud` field contained in the JWT token. Only used when `jwtSetUri` is set.                               |

### Container

Settings related to embedded Jetty container, which serves the Optimize application.

### Elasticsearch

These settings are only relevant when operating Optimize with Elasticsearch.

#### Elasticsearch connection settings

Everything that is related to building the connection to Elasticsearch.

Please note that you can define a number of connection points
in a cluster. Therefore, everything that is under `es.connection.nodes` is a list of nodes Optimize can connect to.
If you have built an Elasticsearch cluster with several nodes it is recommended to define several connection points so that
if one node fails, Optimize is still able to talk to the cluster.

| es.backup.repositoryName | ""            | The name of the snapshot repository to be used to back up Optimize data. |

### OpenSearch

These settings are only relevant when operating Optimize with OpenSearch.

:::note
Not all Optimize features are supported when using OpenSearch as a database, including backups. For a full list of the features that are currently supported, please refer to the [Camunda 7](https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues/705) and [Camunda 8](https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues/635) OpenSearch features.

#### OpenSearch connection settings

This section details everything related to building the connection to OpenSearch.

:::note
You can define a number of connection points in a cluster. Therefore, everything under `opensearch.connection.nodes` is a list of nodes Optimize can connect to. If you have built an OpenSearch cluster with several nodes, it is recommended to define several connection points so if one node fails, Optimize is still able to talk to the cluster.

The relevant property differs between entities. For process data, it's the `endTime` of the process instance. For decision data, it's the `evaluationTime` and for ingested events it's the `time` field. The format of the string is ISO_8601 duration. The default value is 2 years. For details on the notation refer to: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) Note: The time component of the ISO_8601 duration is not supported.

| ui.logoutHidden               | false         | Setting this property to true will hide the logout option from the user menu. This is useful if you are using single sign-on and it is not possible for users to logout. |

| externalVariable.variableIndexRollover.maxIndexSizeGB            | 50            | Specifies the maximum size for the external variable index. When shards get too large, query performance can slow down and rolling over an index can bring an improvement. Using this configuration, a rollover will occur when the current external variable index size matches or exceeds the maxIndexSizeGB threshold. |
| externalVariable.variableIndexRollover.scheduleIntervalInMinutes | 10            | The interval in minutes at which to check whether the conditions for a rollover of the external variable index are met, triggering one if required.

| externalVariable.variableIngestion.maxBatchRequestBytes          | 10485760      | Content length limit for a variable ingestion REST API bulk request in bytes. Requests will be rejected when exceeding that limit. Defaults to 10MB. In case this limit is raised you should carefully tune the heap memory accordingly, see Adjust Optimize heap size on how to do that.                                 |
| externalVariable.variableIngestion.maxRequests                   | 5             | The maximum number of variable ingestion requests that can be serviced at any given time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

As a rough guideline, an export of a 50000 raw data report records containing 8 variables on each instance can cause temporary heap memory peaks of up to ~200MB with the actual CSV file having a size of ~20MB. Please adjust the heap memory accordingly, see [Adjust Optimize heap size](./getting-started.md#adjust-optimize-heap-size) on how to do that. |
