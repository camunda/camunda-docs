# How to use the docs

[docs.camunda.io](https://docs.camunda.io) is home to the Camunda Platform 8 docs including all the components. 

Whether you are just reading the docs to understand how Camunda Platform 8 works or helping write the docs, this _meta_ page will give you all the info you need to be successful.

## Structure

Camunda Platform 8 docs are structured in such a way that the documentation is SaaS-first meaning you will be introduced to the components, concepts, and Best Practices based on how they are used in Camunda Platform 8 SaaS.

For new users, this means they will be able to get immediately acquainted with Camunda Platform 8 through the trial experience by navigating the vast majority of the documentation.

### Self-Managed Section

Keen eyes may notice the Self-Managed section in the top navigation or the icon on the main page look a little different than the rest. This is intentional to help distinguish this area in the docs. 

In this section, documentation includes guidance specifically for Self-Managed users that may not apply to SaaS users, including deployment guides for current components of Camunda Platform 8. 

In addition, you can find Optimize documentation for Camunda Platform 7. 

## Badges

As the product matures, the documentation will grow. We are looking for ways to experiment with adding visuals near the top of the docs to help you understand the expectation for a given piece of content.

### Difficulty badges

Our getting started guides are for beginners and always will be. But not all of our guides will be getting started guides! Look for these labels to help you understand what's the best guide for your level.

### Time estimate badges

We use a mix of word count and reading estimates mixed with hands-on experience to determine our estimations. 

<span class="badge badge--short">Time estimate: 5 minutes</span>

`<span class="badge badge--short">Time estimate: 5 minutes</span>`

<span class="badge badge--medium">Time estimate: 20 minutes</span>

### Product or component specific badges

Shipping incrementally means we may not always be at feature parity between Camunda Platform 8 and Camunda Platform 7 or Desktop Modeler and Web Modeler. 

In those instances, big or small, we want to make sure you can see what works for what product or component.
