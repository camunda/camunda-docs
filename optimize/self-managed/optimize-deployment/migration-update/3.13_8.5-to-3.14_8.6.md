### Camunda 7

In Optimize, the minimum supported version of `Java` is 21.

See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#camunda-platform-7--optimize-version-matrix) section for the full range of supported versions.

### Camunda 8

In Optimize, the minimum supported version of `Java` is 21.

See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#component-requirements) section for the full range of supported versions.

#### Docker tag naming convention

Please note that the Docker tag naming conventions have been updated:

- For Camunda 8, the Optimize Docker tag `latest` has been changed to `8-latest`.
- For Camunda 7, Optimize continues to use the `latest` tag.
