:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.10, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 3.10.x can be performed from any 3.9.x release.

## Changes in the configuration

In the 3.10 version of Optimize, it is no longer possible to configure the UI header. The following
configuration options have therefore been deprecated:

- ui.header.textColor
- ui.header.pathToLogoIcon
- ui.header.backgroundColor
