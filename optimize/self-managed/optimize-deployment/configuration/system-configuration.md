description: "An overview of all possible configuration options in Optimize."
---

All distributions of Camunda Optimize come with a predefined set of configuration options that can be overwritten by the user, based on current environment requirements. To do that, have a look into the folder named `config` which contains a file called `environment-config.yaml` with values that override the default Optimize properties.

You can see a sample configuration file with all possible configuration fields
and their default values [here](service-config.yaml).

In the following section, you will find descriptions and default values of the configuration fields with their respective YAML path.

:::note Heads Up
For changes in the configuration to take effect, you need to restart Optimize!
:::

### Java system properties & OS environment variable placeholders

To externalize configuration properties from the `environment-config.yaml`, Optimize provides variable placeholder support.

The order in which placeholders are resolved is the following:

1. Java system properties
2. OS environment variables

The placeholder format is `${VARIABLE_NAME}` and allows you to refer to a value of a Java system property or OS environment variable of your choice.
The `VARIABLE_NAME` is required to contain only lowercase or uppercase letters, digits and underscore `_` characters and shall not begin with a digit. The corresponding regular expression is `([a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*)`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET}
```

Given this variable is set before Optimize is started, for example on Unix systems with:

```
export AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=sampleTokenValue
```

The value will be resolved at startup to `sampleTokenValue`.

However, if the same variable is provided at the same time as a Java system property, for example via passing `-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue` to the Optimize startup script:

```
./optimize-startup.sh -DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue
```

The value would be resolved to `othertokenValue` as Java system properties have precedence over OS environment variables.

:::note
For Windows users, to pass Java system properties to the provided Windows Batch script `optimize-startup.bat`, you have to put them into double quotes when using the `cmd.exe` shell, as shown below.
:::

```
optimize-startup.bat "-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"
```

For the Windows Powershell in three double quotes:

```
./optimize-startup.bat """-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"""
```

#### Default values

For variable placeholders it's also possible to provide default values using the following format: `${VARIABLE_NAME:DEFAULT_VALUE}`. The `DEFAULT_VALUE` can contain any character except `}`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET:defaultSecret}
```

### Security

These values control mechanisms of Optimize related security, e.g. security headers and authentication.

### Public API

This section focuses on common properties related to the Public REST API of Optimize. It is
mandatory to configure one of the values below if the Public REST API is to be used. If neither is
configured an error will be thrown and all requests to the Public API will get rejected. If both are configured then
the `jwtSetUri` will take precedence and the `accessToken` will be ignored.

| YAML Path       | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api.accessToken | null          | Secret static shared token to be provided to the secured REST API in the authorization header. Will be ignored if `api.jwtSetUri` is also set. |
| api.jwtSetUri   | null          | Complete URI to get public keys for JWT validation, e.g. `https://weblogin.cloud.company.com/.well-known/jwks.json`                            |
| api.audience    | optimize      | Optimize tries to match this with the `aud` field contained in the JWT token. Only used when `jwtSetUri` is set.                               |

### Container

### Elasticsearch

Settings related to Elasticsearch.

#### Connection settings

Everything that is related to building the connection to Elasticsearch.

Please note that you can define a number of connection points
in a cluster. Therefore, everything that is under `es.connection.nodes` is a list of nodes Optimize can connect to.
If you have built an Elasticsearch cluster with several nodes it is recommended to define several connection points so that
if one node fails, Optimize is still able to talk to the cluster.

| historyCleanup.cronTrigger                                                       | `'0 1 * * *'` | Cron expression to schedule when the cleanup should be executed, defaults to 01:00 A.M. As the cleanup can cause considerable load on the underlying Elasticsearch database it is recommended to schedule it outside of office hours. You can either use the default Cron (5 fields) or the Spring Cron (6 fields) expression format here. For details on the format please refer to: [Cron Expression Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or [Spring Cron Expression Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html) |
| historyCleanup.ttl                                                               | 'P2Y'         | Global time to live (ttl) period for process/decision/event data. The relevant property differs between entities. For process data, it's the `endTime` of the process instance. For decision data, it's the `evaluationTime` and for ingested events it's the `time` field. The format of the string is ISO_8601 duration. The default value is 2 years. For details on the notation refer to: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) Note: The time component of the ISO_8601 duration is not supported. Only years (Y), months (M) and days (D) are.        |

It may be reduced if requests fail due to request size constraints. In most cases, this should not be necessary and has only been experienced when connecting to an AWS Elasticsearch instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| localization.availableLocales | ['en','de']   | All locales available in the Optimize Frontend. <br /><br />Note: for languages other than the default there must be a `<localeCode>.json` file available under ./config/localization. |
| localization.fallbackLocale   | 'en'          | The fallback locale used if there is a locale requested that is not available in availableLocales. The fallbackLocale is required to be present in localization.availableLocales.      |

### UI Configuration

Customize the Optimize UI e.g. by adjusting the logo, head background color etc.

| YAML Path                 | Default Value           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ui.header.textColor       | 'dark'                  | Determines the color theme of the text in the header. Currently 'dark' and 'light' are supported.                                                                                                                                        |
| ui.header.pathToLogoIcon  | 'logo/camunda_icon.svg' | Path to the logo that is displayed in the header of Optimize. Path can be: relative: starting from the config folder you can provide a relative path. absolute: full path in the file system. Supported image formats can be found here. |
| ui.header.backgroundColor | '#FFFFFF'               | A hex encoded color that should be used as background color for the header. Default color is white.                                                                                                                                      |

| export.csv.limit                              | 1000                       | Maximum number of records returned by CSV export.<br /><br /> Note: Increasing this value comes at a memory cost for the Optimize application that varies based on the actual data. As a rough guideline, an export of a 50000 raw data report records containing 8 variables on each instance can cause temporary heap memory peaks of up to ~200MB with the actual CSV file having a size of ~20MB. Please adjust the heap memory accordingly, see [Adjust Optimize heap size](./getting-started.md#adjust-optimize-heap-size) on how to do that. |
