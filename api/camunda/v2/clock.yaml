        [[CONSISTENCY:STRONG]]

        Set a precise, static time for the Zeebe engine's internal clock.
        When the clock is pinned, it remains at the specified time and does not advance.
        To change the time, the clock must be pinned again with a new timestamp.

      description: |


        [[CONSISTENCY:STRONG]]

        Resets the Zeebe engine's internal clock to the current system time, enabling it to tick in real-time.
        This operation is useful for returning the clock to
        normal behavior after it has been pinned to a specific time.
