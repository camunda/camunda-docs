# Algolia DocSearch

This directory has configuration for Algolia DocSearch. Mainly the crawler config in the file [crawler.config.js](./crawler.config.js)

> [!CAUTION]
> The crawler.config.js file is here just **for visibility**. It's a copy of the crawler config in Algolia; it doesn't auto-sync with Algolia.
> I.e., you need to manually update the file in the repo by copy-paste from Algolia UI.
