After login you'll see the console overview page. Since you haven't created a cluster, the overview will be empty.

In the upper right area you'll find the button **Create New Cluster**. Click on it to create a new cluster. After you've assigned a name and created the cluster, a new entry appears in the overview:

The cluster is now being set up. During this phase, its state is _Creating_. After one or two minutes the cluster is ready for use and changes its state to _Healthy_:

After the cluster has been created, you can jump into the cluster detail page by clicking on the cluster name.
