:::note
Opting-in to Camunda alpha terms currently only applies to Enterprise SaaS subscriptions.
Customers in other subscriptions can still turn on/off these settings directly from Console.  
:::

If you aren't already familiar with accessing **alpha features**, learn more in our [alpha feature documentation](/components/early-access/alpha/alpha-features.md).

Alpha terms typically refer to the specific terms and conditions that govern the use and testing of this software during its alpha phase. These terms outline the rights, responsibilities, and limitations of both the software provider (Camunda) and the users (alpha testers or early adopters) during the testing and evaluation period.

Alpha terms help protect Camunda´s interests (such as protecting our intellectual property, disclaiming warranties, or limiting our liability for any issues or damages that may arise during the alpha phase), manage user expectations, encourage active participation and feedback, and ensure legal compliance during the pre-release phase of software development.

:::note
Enabling alpha features is limited to [admin users and owners](/components/console/manage-organization/manage-users.md) of Camunda products.

2. Under the **Settings** tab, click **Opt-in** under the **Alpha features** box.
