[Camunda agentic orchestration](https://camunda.com/agentic-orchestration/) allows you to orchestrate AI agents within your BPMN-based workflows, enabling human tasks, deterministic rule sets, and AI-driven decisions to collaborate in a robust, end-to-end process.

Agentic orchestration ensures your AI-driven processes are efficient, compliant, and aligned with business goals.

## About agentic orchestration

In Camunda, agentic orchestration refers to the use of one or more AI agents to execute the non-deterministic parts of a process.

Real-world process automation requires a blending of deterministic and dynamic (AI-driven) process orchestration. You can increase the scope of process automation to handle work traditionally requiring human case management, and provide a much higher level of flexibility for straight-through processing (STP).

For example, Camunda offers a systemic, future-ready approach for agentic AI by building on the proven foundation of BPMN.
