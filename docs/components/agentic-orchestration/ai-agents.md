## About AI agents

An AI agent is a software program that autonomously gathers data and carries out tasks using this information, independently or on behalf of another system or person. AI agents can perform a variety of functions, including making decisions, solving problems, interacting with external environments, and taking actions. 

For example, in your process you could use an AI agent to select and execute tasks within an ad-hoc sub-process, by evaluating the current process context and determining the relevant tasks and tools to use in response.
