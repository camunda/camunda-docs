This section of the documentation features Camunda's various integrations. Currently, this consists of Camunda's SAP integration, including:

- **[CSAP setup command line utility](/components/camunda-integrations/sap/csap-cli.md)**: A CLI to configure all SAP integration artifacts for deployment.
- **[SAP OData connector](/components/camunda-integrations/sap/odata-connector.md)**: A protocol and outbound connector that runs as a Docker image on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).
- **[Business Technology Platform (BTP) plugin](/components/camunda-integrations/sap/btp-plugin.md)**: An artifact run on BTP. This connects to Camunda 8 SaaS to provide a generic Fiori app for starting BPMN processes and displaying [Camunda Forms](/components/modeler/forms/camunda-forms-reference.md) in the Fiori design language, the select exposure of SAP BTP services to [BPMN tasks](/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn.md) and vice versa, and a generic endpoint to start BPMN processes with.
- **[SAP RFC connector](/components/camunda-integrations/sap/rfc-connector.md)**: A Java Spring Boot application that runs on SAP BTP.
