Extend the power of your process orchestration by connecting Camunda with your core enterprise systems. Our pre-built integrations simplify communication across platforms and enable true end-to-end automation in your technology landscape.

The following integrations are available out of the box:

## ServiceNow integration

Camunda’s ServiceNow integration bridges your business processes with IT service management (ITSM) to streamline and automate service delivery.

With this integration, you can:

- **Manage ServiceNow data**  
  Create, read, update, and delete records in any ServiceNow table directly from a Camunda process.

- **Trigger ServiceNow flows**  
  Initiate automations built in ServiceNow's Flow Designer as part of an end-to-end process.

:::note
Use this integration when you need to orchestrate processes that involve ITSM tasks or require seamless collaboration between ServiceNow and other business systems.

## SAP integration

Camunda’s SAP integration allows you to include SAP S/4HANA, ECC, and Business Technology Platform (BTP) functionality in your orchestrated processes.

With this integration, you can:

- **Execute core SAP functions**  
  Call BAPIs and Remote Function Modules (RFCs) in SAP S/4HANA or ECC directly from Camunda.

- **Connect to SAP BTP**  
  Integrate with services and applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform to build comprehensive, cross-platform workflows.

:::note
This integration is ideal for organizations standardizing on SAP systems while extending automation to non-SAP applications and services.
