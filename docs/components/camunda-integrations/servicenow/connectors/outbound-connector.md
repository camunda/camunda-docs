title: ServiceNow Outbound Connector
description: "Perform CRUD operations on any ServiceNow table directly from Camunda processes using the ServiceNow Outbound Connector."
---

The **ServiceNow Outbound Connector** allows Camunda processes to interact directly with ServiceNow tables through REST APIs.  
You can create, read, update, and delete records in any table, enabling powerful integrations without writing custom scripts.

---

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Description | Example Use Case |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Create** | Inserts a new record into a ServiceNow table. | Creating a new incident or service request from a Camunda process. |
| **Read** | Retrieves records from a ServiceNow table using query parameters. | Looking up user details or checking incident status. |
| **Update** | Modifies fields of an existing record. | Updating ticket status or assignment group. |
| **Delete** | Removes a record from a table by its `sys_id`. | Deleting temporary or test records after processing. |

---

## Configuration

In Camunda Modeler, configure the ServiceNow Outbound Connector by selecting **ServiceNow Outbound Connector** from the connector templates or download it from the Camunda Marketplace.  

The following fields are typically required:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Instance name** | Only the name of your ServiceNow instance (e.g. `your-instance-name`). |
| **Operation** | One of `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, or `Delete`. |
| **Target table** | The target ServiceNow table (e.g. `incident`, `sc_task`, `sc_req_item`) |
| **Payload** | JSON data that needs to be sent to ServiceNow for `Create` and `Update` operations. |
| **Authentication** | ServiceNow credentials (username and password) stored securely in Camunda Secrets and referenced in the connector configuration. (e.g. `{{secrets.snUser}}`)|
| **Query parameters** | For `Read` operations, used to filter records separated by multiple conditions with '^' (e.g: `active=true^priority=1`) |
| **Sys ID of the record** | Required for `Update` and `Delete` operations to identify the target record. |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Store your ServiceNow credentials securely as [Camunda Secrets](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/secrets/) and reference them in the connector configuration.
