### About the integration

Camundaâ€™s ServiceNow integration follows a **hybrid approach** that combines:
- **Custom actions in the ServiceNow Camunda Spoke** for initiating or correlating Camunda processes from ServiceNow.  
- **Camunda Connectors & Element Templates** for interacting with ServiceNow tables and flows from Camunda processes.
