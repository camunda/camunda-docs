## Key features

The ServiceNow integration enables:

- **Bi-directional integration between ServiceNow and Camunda**  
  Seamless communication between ServiceNow flows and Camunda processes to bring orchestration capabilities to ServiceNow.

- **End-to-end orchestration for ServiceNow**  
  Orchestrate activities inside ServiceNow and across other systems end-to-end using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation).

- **Manage records within ServiceNow**  
  Create, read, modify, or delete any ServiceNow record from a BPMN orchestration.

## Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- **Developers** implementing workflows that interact with ServiceNow.
- **Solution architects** designing process automation across Camunda and ServiceNow.
- **Administrators** managing integration configuration and security.

## About the integration

Camundaâ€™s ServiceNow integration follows a **hybrid approach** that combines:

- **Custom actions in the ServiceNow Camunda Spoke** for initiating or correlating Camunda processes from ServiceNow.
- **Camunda connectors and element templates** for interacting with ServiceNow tables and flows from Camunda processes.
