Use Camunda to automate workflows that interact with ServiceNow IT Service Management (ITSM), enabling seamless communication between BPMN processes and ServiceNow workflows.

## Key features

The integration enables you to:

- Bi-directionally integrate Camunda and ServiceNow to orchestrate flows and processes.
- Orchestrate activities inside ServiceNow and across systems end-to-end using BPMN.
- Manage records in ServiceNow: create, read, modify, or delete any record directly from Camunda processes.

## Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- Developers implementing workflows that interact with ServiceNow.
- Solution architects designing process automation across Camunda and ServiceNow.
- Administrators managing integration configuration and security.

## About the integration

Camundaâ€™s ServiceNow integration combines:

- Custom actions in the ServiceNow Camunda Spoke to start or correlate Camunda processes from ServiceNow.
- Camunda connectors and element templates to interact with ServiceNow tables and flows from Camunda processes.
