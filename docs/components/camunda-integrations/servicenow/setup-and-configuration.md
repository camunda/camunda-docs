title: Setup & Configuration
description: "Install the Camunda Spoke in ServiceNow, configure connectors in Camunda, and set up secure credentials to enable bi-directional communication between both systems."
---

The setup and configuration process connects your ServiceNow instance with Camunda so that workflows can securely exchange data and trigger actions in both directions. This involves installing and configuring the Camunda Spoke on your ServiceNow instance, setting up the ServiceNow connectors in Camunda, and establishing secure credentials for communication. Once configured, you can start and control Camunda processes from ServiceNow, and likewise, interact with ServiceNow tables and flows directly from BPMN processesâ€”enabling true end-to-end orchestration.

> ðŸ’¡ **Before you begin**  
> Make sure you have the following in place before starting the setup:
>
> - âœ… **Administrator access** to both Camunda and ServiceNow instances.  
> - âœ… Your ServiceNow instance meets all [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md), including required plugins and user permissions.  
> - âœ… Network connectivity between Camunda and ServiceNow is allowed by your organization's security settings.
