description: Integrate legacy applications into Camunda with robotic process automation (RPA).

Use RPA to integrate legacy systems without APIs into your Camunda processes.

## About RPA

Robotic process automation (RPA) allows you to automate manual, repetitive tasks by interacting with legacy mainframe applications, desktop applications such as ERP systems, or websites that do not expose APIs.

Camunda uses RPA to integrate legacy applications without accessible APIs into your process orchestration.

## Get started with RPA

Camunda’s RPA functionality is built around a standalone RPA worker and Robot Framework–based RPA scripts. This setup allows you to develop and execute RPA scripts that integrate seamlessly with your existing Camunda components.
