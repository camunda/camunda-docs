Camunda 8 SaaS and Self-Managed provide built-in support for storing, tracking, and managing documents using Camunda Forms, Connectors, Tasklist, and the [Camunda 8 REST API](/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/specifications/create-documents.api.mdx).

Document handling is automatically integrated into each SaaS cluster, allowing you to manage binary data, like PDFs, images and other file types, across development and production environments without needing to configure or maintain storage infrastructure yourself.

## Use cases and capabilities

Document handling can be beneficial for different process use cases, such as uploading a document to a BPMN process, displaying and downloading a document, sending a document to an external system via a Connector, and automating documents with [intelligent document processing](/components/modeler/web-modeler/idp/idp-example.md).

Step through all of these capabilities in the [use cases](/components/document-handling/use-cases/overview.md) section.
