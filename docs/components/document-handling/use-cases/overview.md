import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Offering robust [document handling](/components/document-handling/getting-started.md) capabilities within Camunda SaaS and Self-Managed, users can efficiently manage large volumes of binary data such as PDFs and images across both development and production environments.

In this section we will cover three main use cases:

- [Upload a document to a BPMN process](/components/document-handling/use-cases/upload-document-to-bpmn-process.md);
- [Display and download a document](/components/document-handling/use-cases/display-and-download-document.md);
- [Send a document to an external system via a Connector](/components/document-handling/use-cases/send-document-to-external-system.md).

## Automate documents with intelligent document processing

Document handling can be integrated with intelligent document processing (IDP).
This allows you to extract specific data from a high volume of documents using an IDP application, and use the extracted data throughout your BPMN process.

Learn more about this in the IDP documentation:
