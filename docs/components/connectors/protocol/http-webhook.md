description: Start a process instance with your custom webhook configuration, triggered by an external HTTP call.
---

The **HTTP Webhook Connector** is an inbound Connector that allows you to start a BPMN process instance triggered by external HTTP call.

:::note
If you have used the HTTP Webhook Connector with a self-managed Camunda 8 configuration before the
Connector SDK [0.7.0 release](https://github.com/camunda/connector-sdk/releases/tag/0.7.0), you might need to manually replace the element template.
Please refer to the [update guide](/guides/update-guide/connectors/060-to-070.md) for more details.
:::

## Create an HTTP Webhook Connector event

1. Start building your BPMN diagram. You can use HTTP Webhook Connector with either **Start Event** or **Intermediate Catch Event** building blocks.
2. Select the applicable element and change its template to an HTTP Webhook.
3. Fill in all required properties.
4. Complete your BPMN diagram.
5. Deploy the diagram to activate the webhook.
6. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab in the properties panel to see the webhook URL.

## Make your HTTP Webhook Connector executable

1. In the **Webhook Configuration** section, configure the **Webhook ID**. By default, **Webhook ID** is pre-filled with a random value. This value will be part of the Webhook URL. You will find more details about HTTP Webhook URLs [below](#activate-the-http-webhook-connector-by-deploying-your-diagram).
2. Configure [**HMAC authentication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC):
   If you require HMAC authentication for your webhook, you can set up the HMAC shared secret key, HMAC header, HMAC hash algorithm, and an array of HMAC scopes.

   - **HMAC secret key**: Set the HMAC shared secret key that will be used to calculate the message hash. The value of this key should be provided by the webhook provider to ensure secure communication.
   - **HMAC header**: Set the HMAC header whose value contains an encrypted hash message. The exact value of this header should be provided by the external caller when invoking your webhook.
   - **HMAC hash algorithm**: Select the HMAC hash algorithm to be used in the HMAC signature calculation. The exact value of this algorithm should also be provided by the external caller when invoking your webhook.
   - **HMAC Scopes** (optional): Here, you can define an array of HMAC scopes to specify which parts of the webhook request are included in the HMAC signature calculation. The available HMAC scopes are:

     - `BODY` (default value): Includes the body of the webhook request in the HMAC signature calculation.
     - `URL`: Includes the URL of the webhook request in the HMAC signature calculation.
     - `PARAMETERS`: Includes the query parameters of the URL in the HMAC signature calculation.

     Example: `=["URL","PARAMETERS"]`

     Based on the selected HMAC scopes and the HTTP method used in the webhook request, the system will automatically determine the appropriate HMAC strategy to be used. The supported HMAC strategies are:

     - **Body Encoding Strategy (default)**: This strategy is used when the HMAC scopes only include `BODY` or empty. The signature data for the HMAC signature is generated from the body of the webhook request.

     - **URL and Parameters Encoding Strategy**: This strategy is used when the HMAC scopes include `URL`, and `PARAMETERS`, and the HTTP method is `GET`. The signature data for the HMAC signature is generated by combining the URL and the parameters of the webhook request.

     - **URL and Body Encoding Strategy**: This strategy is used when the HMAC scopes include `URL`, `BODY`. When the HTTP method is `GET`, it uses the **URL and Parameters Encoding Strategy** instead. The signature data for the HMAC signature is generated by combining the URL and the body of the webhook request.

       **Example for URL and Parameters Encoding Strategy**:
       Let's consider a sample webhook request:

       ```
       HTTP Method: GET
       Webhook URL: "https://example.com/webhook?id=123456&name=John%20Doe"
       ```

       In this example, the HMAC strategy will combine the URL and the query parameters to generate the signature data for the HMAC signature. The URL-encoded query parameters will be sorted alphabetically, and then, they will be concatenated with the URL: Signature Data: `https://example.com/webhook?name=John%20Doe&id=123456`
       The `Signature Data` will then be used to calculate the HMAC signature using the provided secret key and hash algorithm.

       **Example for URL and Body Encoding Strategy**:
       Let's consider another sample webhook request:

       ```
       HTTP Method: POST
       Webhook URL: `https://example.com/webhook`
       Webhook Body: `{"id": 123456, "name": "John Doe", "age": 30}`
       ```

       In this example, the HMAC strategy will combine the URL and the body of the webhook request to generate the signature data for the HMAC signature:
       Signature Data: `https://example.com/webhook{"id":123456,"name":"John Doe","age":30}`
       The `Signature Data` will then be used to calculate the HMAC signature using the provided secret key and hash algorithm.

3. Configure **Activation Condition**. For example, given external caller triggers a webhook endpoint with the body `{"id": 1, "status": "OK"}`, the **Activation Condition** value might look like `=(request.body.status = "OK")`. Leave this field empty to trigger your webhook every time.
4. Use **Variable Mapping** to map specific fields from the request into process variables using [FEEL](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).
   For example, given the external caller triggers a webhook endpoint with the body `{"id": 1, "status": "OK"}` and you would like to extract `id` as a process variable `myDocumentId`, the **Result Expression** might look like this:

```
= {
  myDocumentId: request.body.id
}
```

6. If you are using the HTTP Webhook Connector with an **Intermediate Catch Event**, fill in the **Correlation key (process)** and **Correlation key (payload)**.

- **Correlation key (process)** is a FEEL expression that defines the correlation key for the subscription. This corresponds to the **Correlation key** property of a regular **Message Intermediate Catch Event**.
- **Correlation key (payload)** is a FEEL expression used to extract the correlation key from the incoming message. This expression is evaluated in the Connector Runtime and the result is used to correlate the message.

For example, given that your correlation key is defined with `orderId` process variable, and the request body contains `{"orderId": "123"}`, your correlation key settings will look like this:

- **Correlation key (process)**: `=orderId`
- **Correlation key (payload)**: `=request.body.orderId`

Learn more about correlation keys in the [messages guide](../../../concepts/messages).

## Activate the HTTP Webhook Connector by deploying your diagram

Once you click the **Deploy** button, your HTTP Webhook will be activated and publicly available.
You can trigger it by making a POST request to the generated URL.

:::note
HTTP Webhook Connector currently supports only POST requests.
:::

URLs of the exposed HTTP Webhooks adhere to the following pattern:

`http(s)://<base URL>/inbound/<webhook ID>>`

- `<base URL>` is the URL of Connectors component deployment. When using the Camunda Platform 8 SaaS offering, this will typically contain your cluster region and cluster ID.
- `<webhook ID>` is the ID (path) you configured in the properties of your HTTP Webhook Connector.

If you make changes to your HTTP Webhook Connector configuration, you need to redeploy the BPMN diagram for the changes to take effect.

When you click on the event with HTTP Webhook Connector applied to it, a new **Webhooks** tab will appear in the properties panel.
This tab displays the URL of the HTTP Webhook Connector for every cluster where you have deployed your BPMN diagram.

:::note
The **Webhooks** tab is only supported in Web Modeler as part of the Camunda Platform 8 SaaS offering.
You can still use HTTP Webhook Connector in Desktop Modeler, or with your Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed.
In that case, HTTP Webhook Connector deployments and URLs will not be displayed in Modeler.

### Example

Give a use-case when you need to configure a GitHub webhook with an **HTTP Webhook Connector** in such a way that: (1) your BPMN process starts on every opened PR, and (2) the PR URL is exposed as a process variable.
Let's say you choose `mySecretKey` as a shared secret passphrase. GitHub [declares](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks) that they use `X-Hub-Signature-256` header for `SHA-256` HMAC.
Therefore, you would need to set the following:

1. **Webhook ID**: any unique to your cluster webhook ID. This will generate a URL to trigger your webhook. In example, `myWebhookPath`.
2. **HMAC Authentication**: `enabled`.
3. **HMAC Secret Key**: `mySecretKey` or `{{secrets.MY_GH_SECRET}}`.
4. **HMAC Header**: `X-Hub-Signature-256`.
5. **HMAC Algorithm**: `SHA-256`.
6. **Activation Condition**: `=(request.body.action = "opened")`.
7. **Variable Mapping**: `={prUrl: request.body.pull_request.url}`.
8. Click `Deploy`.

:::note
For GitHub, there is a simplified [GitHub Webhook Connector](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/github-webhook.md).
