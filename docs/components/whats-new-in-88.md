Learn about important changes in Camunda 8.8 to consider when planning your upgrade from Camunda 8.7.

## Introducing Camunda 8.8

Camunda 8.8 introduces important architectural changes and enhancements to simplify deployment, improve maintainability, and empower both operations teams and developers.

The simplest Self-Managed deployment now involves running a single Java application or docker container of the Orchestration Cluster Application.

## Orchestration Cluster {#orchestration-cluster}

The primary architectural change is the consolidation of the core Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Identity components into the Orchestration Cluster (a single unified deployable package). This impacts how Camunda 8 is deployed, managed, and scaled.

The Orchestration cluster (previously automation cluster) is now the core component of Camunda 8.

### Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Identity

In Camunda 8.8, Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Identity are consolidated into the Orchestration Cluster application as a single deployable artifact, distributed as a JAR file or Docker container.

- [Zeebe](../reference/glossary.md#zeebe) is the [workflow engine](../reference/glossary.md#workflow-engine).
- Operate is used for monitoring and troubleshooting [process instances](../reference/glossary.md#process-instance) running in Zeebe.
- Tasklist is used for interacting with [user tasks](../reference/glossary.md#user-task) (assigning, completing, and so on).
- [Identity](../reference/glossary.md#identity) is used for managing the integrated Orchestration Cluster authentication and authorization.

In Camunda 8.7 and earlier, each component (Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Identity) was deployed independently.

### Unified Orchestration Cluster REST API {#orchestration-cluster-api}

Camunda 8.8 introduces a single unified [Orchestration Cluster REST API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md) you can use to interact programmatically with the Orchestration Cluster.

- This replaces component APIs (Operate API, Tasklist API, Zeebe API, and much of Identity API) with a single set of endpoints.
- This unified API supports both organizational (SaaS) and Self-Managed deployments.
- This is now the default and recommended integration point for developers, operators, and automation solutions.

### Deprecated Operate, Tasklist, and Zeebe gRPC API endpoints

### New Java/Spring SDK, Node.js -->

### Unified Exporter

Camunda 8.8 introduces a new unified exporter architecture to improve cluster management and data migration. The new exporter architecture provides two dedicated Helm jobs for Identity migration and process application migration.

In Camunda 8.7 and earlier, dedicated importers/exporters were used for data flows between components (such as Elasticsearch import/export).

### Unified component configuration

Camunda 8.8 introduces a unified configuration for Orchestration Cluster components where you can define all essential cluster and component behavior through a single, centralized configuration system.

In Camunda 8.7 and earlier, managing and configuring core components (Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, Identity) was done separately.

## Identity, authentication, and authorization {#identity}

Camunda 8.8 includes changes to how you manage authentication and authorization with Identity.

### Identity

The Identity service is now fully integrated into the Orchestration Cluster.

- Instead of relying on a separate PostgreSQL database, Identity now uses Zeebeâ€™s persistence storage. This reinforces consistency and reduces the need to manage additional databases.
- Identity is decoupled from Keycloak. While Keycloak remains supported, Camunda 8.8 now allows direct integration of any OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible identity provider, increasing flexibility for authentication.

### Access control and authorization management

Groups and roles that were previously managed via the Console are now maintained directly within Orchestration Cluster Identity.
Console-based changes to groups/roles are no longer effective for 8.8 clusters after upgrade.

### Summary of Identity changes

The following table provides a summary of the main Identity changes.

| Feature/area               | Camunda 8.7 and earlier                | Camunda 8.8                 |

| [Zeebe gRPC API endpoints](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/880-announcements.md#deprecated-zeebe-grpc-api-endpoints) | With the 8.8 release, the gRPC API continues but is being disabled by default starting with 8.10.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
