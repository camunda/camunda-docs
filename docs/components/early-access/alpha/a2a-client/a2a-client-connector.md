---

The A2A Client connector is used to interact with A2A agents. It performs two main actions: retrieving the _Agent Card_ of a remote agent and sending messages to that agent.

## Prerequisites

To use the A2A Client connector, you need to have access to an A2A-compliant agent and its corresponding Agent Card URL.

## Create an A2A Client connector task

import ConnectorTask from '../../../react-components/connector-task.md'

<ConnectorTask/>

## Make your A2A Client connector executable

To make the **A2A Client connector** executable, fill out the mandatory fields highlighted in red in the properties panel on the right side of the screen.

The **A2A Client connector** supports two distinct operational modes to accommodate different use cases: **standalone mode** and **AI Agent tool mode**.

### 1. Standalone mode

In standalone mode, the connector is used directly in a BPMN process as a service task. You explicitly configure the operation to perform and all associated parameters.

The connector requires the following configuration:

- HTTP Connection
  - **A2A server URL** (required): The base URL of the A2A server
    - Example: `http://localhost:10000`
  - **Agent card location** (optional): Path to the agent card endpoint relative to the base URL
    - Default: `.well-known/agent-card.json`
- Connector Mode
  - Select "Standalone"
- Operation: when in standalone mode, you can choose between two operations:
  1. **Fetch Agent Card**
  2. **Send Message**

#### Fetch Agent Card

Retrieves the [Agent Card](https://a2a-protocol.org/v0.3.0/specification/#5-agent-discovery-the-agent-card) from the remote A2A server, which describes the agent's capabilities, skills, etc.

**Configuration:** No additional parameters are required.

**Response:**
Returns a JSON object containing the most relevant Agent Card details. Here is an example of the returned JSON:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "name": "Weather agent",
    "description": "Helps with weather information",
    "skills": [
      {
        "id": "weather-forecast",
        "name": "Weather Forecast",
        "description": "Get weather forecast information",
        "tags": ["forecast", "weather"],
        "examples": [
          "What's the weather like today in Berlin?",
          "Will it rain tomorrow in London?"
        ],
        "inputModes": ["text"],
        "outputModes": ["text"]
      }
    ],
    "kind": "agentCard"
  },
  "pollingData": {
    "id": "20be510a-9e12-40c2-ad4d-899ded442db3"
  }
}
```

Learn more about the response structure [here](#response-structure)

#### Send message

Sends a message to the remote agent and handles the response based on the configured retrieval method.

**Configuration:**

- **Text** (required): The message to send to the remote agent
- **Context ID** (optional): The context ID for grouping related interactions
  - Typically generated by the remote server; omit for first message or new context
- **Task ID** (optional): The ID of the task this message is part of
  - Generated by the remote server; omit if not part of a specific task
- **Reference Task IDs** (optional): List of task IDs that this message references for context
  - FEEL expression; for example: `= ["e240a538-a857-4e88-b3d0-4ddaf4882cc6", "eb086e57-43e3-45c1-a944-9a23a8b823df"]`
- **Documents** (optional): List of [Camunda document references](/components/document-handling/getting-started.md) to include with the message. This supports the same document types as the [AI Agent connector](../../../connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent-subprocess.md#supported-document-types).
- **Response retrieval** (required): How to receive the final response from the remote agent
  - **Blocking**: Waits synchronously for the agent's response
  - **Polling**: Returns immediately with a task with `submitted` or `working` state; use the A2A Client Polling Connector to retrieve results
  - **Notification**: Configures a webhook for the remote agent to push notifications about the task status updates; use the A2A Client Webhook Connector to receive notifications
    - **Webhook URL** (required): URL where the agent will send the response. See [A2A Client Webhook Connector](./?a2a=webhook) for how to set up a webhook endpoint.
    - **Token** (optional): Unique token for validating notifications. It can be a static value or generated using a FEEL expression.
      - For a random token, you can use the FEEL expression `= uuid()`
    - **Authentication schemes** (optional): List of auth schemes required by the webhook
    - **Authentication credentials** (optional): Credentials to authenticate webhook requests
      :::note
      You can only use the **Notification** response retrieval method if the remote agent supports it. Check the agent's capabilities in its Agent Card.
      :::
- **History length** (optional): Number of most recent messages from task history to include in response
  - Default: `3`
- **Response timeout** (optional): Maximum time to wait for (the first) response as ISO-8601 duration
  - Default: `PT1M` (1 minute)

**Response:** Returns a JSON object containing the remote agent's response.

Here is an example of the resulting JSON when the remote agent replies with a [Message](https://a2a-protocol.org/v0.3.0/specification/#64-message-object):

```json
{
  "result": {
    "kind": "message",
    "role": "agent",
    "messageId": "202dc848-05d7-4aff-a147-45ba42c765b1",
    "contextId": "5b70baac-065e-4680-ace9-81289e67f51d",
    "contents": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Based on the weather forecast, it looks like it will be sunny in Berlin today with a high of 25°C and a low of 15°C."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is an example of the resulting JSON when the remote agent replies with a [Task](https://a2a-protocol.org/v0.3.0/specification/#61-task-object) in the `submitted` state:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "kind": "task",
    "id": "1f184812-0926-4f2c-881c-65c158a6dd11",
    "contextId": "8802db7b-8401-46b0-89f8-1ec3d5e81194",
    "status": {
      "state": "submitted",
      "message": {
        "kind": "message",
        "role": "agent",
        "messageId": "3fc30325-d5d2-4d7a-a472-e197fb478acc",
        "contextId": "8802db7b-8401-46b0-89f8-1ec3d5e81194",
        "taskId": "1f184812-0926-4f2c-881c-65c158a6dd11",
        "contents": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Your weather forecast request has been submitted and is being processed. I'm gathering data from multiple weather stations and satellite imagery for your location."
          }
        ]
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-11-27T15:45:47.542Z"
    },
    "history": [
      {
        "kind": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "messageId": "a35df285-783d-4ad7-87b9-16a0bbff7f30",
        "contextId": "8802db7b-8401-46b0-89f8-1ec3d5e81194",
        "taskId": "1f184812-0926-4f2c-881c-65c158a6dd11",
        "contents": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Please provide a 7-day weather forecast for San Francisco, CA including temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "pollingData": {
    "id": "1f184812-0926-4f2c-881c-65c158a6dd11"
  }
}
```

:::info
In this sample response `pollingData` contains the task identifier that is used internally by the **A2A Client Polling connector**.
We assume **Response retrieval** is **Polling**.

### 2. AI Agent tool mode

In AI Agent tool mode, the connector is registered as a tool that can be dynamically invoked by the [AI agent connector](../../../connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/agentic-ai-aiagent.md).
This enables the AI agent to discover and interact with remote A2A agents autonomously based on user requests.

The connector requires the following configuration:

- HTTP Connection
  - Same as in Standalone mode
- Connector Mode
  - Select "AI Agent tool"
- Operation: In AI Agent tool mode, the operation is dynamically determined by the AI agent:
  - **Operation** (required): Automatically populated from `toolCall.operation`
    - Possible values: `fetchAgentCard`, `sendMessage`
  - **Parameters** (optional): Automatically populated from `toolCall.params`
    - Contains the dynamic parameters for the `sendMessage` operation
  - **Response retrieval** (required): Same as in Standalone mode
  - **History length** (optional): Same as in Standalone mode
  - **Response timeout** (optional): Same as in Standalone mode

**How it works:**

1. The **AI Agent connector** detects this connector as an available tool.
2. The AI agent perform a tool discovery using the `fetchAgentCard` operation.
3. When the AI agent determines it needs to interact with the A2A agent, it issues a tool call containing the required parameters.
4. The tool call is translated into a `sendMessage` operation.
5. The connector executes the `sendMessage` operation.
6. Results are returned to the AI agent.
7. If needed, the AI agent engages in a multi-turn conversation with the A2A agent by issuing further tool calls referring to the same context and task IDs. This happens when the remote agent asks for further information.
8. If needed, the AI agent can start new interactions with the A2A agent by issuing new tool calls without context and task IDs.

:::info
When the **AI Agent connector** detects at least one **A2A Client connector** that is configured as a tool, it injects special instructions into the system prompt to guide the LLM on how to use A2A tools.

## Response structure

The response from the **A2A Client connector** is a JSON object with the following fields:

- **result**: Contains the actual response from the remote agent. This can contain either an _Agent Card_, a _message_, or a _task_ object depending on the operation performed.
- **pollingData**: Contains data required internally for polling the task status when using the **Polling** response retrieval method.
- **notificationData**: Contains data required internally when using the **Notification** response retrieval method.
