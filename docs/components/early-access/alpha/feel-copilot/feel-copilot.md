## Get started

:::warning 
Clicking "Use Expression" on a FEEL Copilot response will overwrite existing work.
:::

To use the FEEL Copilot in Web Modeler, take the following steps:
1. If you have not already done so, [opt in](/components/console/manage-organization/enable-alpha-features.md#enable-ai-powered-features) to use this feature.
2. Log in to [Web Modeler](/components/modeler/web-modeler/launch-web-modeler.md).
3. Click **New project > Create new > BPMN diagram**
4. Open a FEEL Popup. In a new diagram, you can click the Start Event (the circle in the diagram), then the + sign next to "Outputs" in the right sidebar. Click "Variable assignment value", then the two overlapping squares on the right side of the field.
5. Click the arrow next to FEEL Copilot to open it
6. In the chat box, enter your prompt. A prompt should be a simple, clear, and concise request. For example, "Find the difference between two dates" or "Get the name from {“name”: “Alice”, "location", "Berlin"}". Note that more complex requests may take longer to process.
7. Wait for the FEEL Copilot to respond. This typically takes between 15-30 seconds, depending on the prompt.

:::note
Timeouts can occur during this step if your query is too complex.
