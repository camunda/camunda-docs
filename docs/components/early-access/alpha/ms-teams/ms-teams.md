MS Teams App Integration lets users view, claim, and complete Camunda tasks directly in Microsoft Teams, including inline task forms—so they can stay in their primary collaboration tool without context switching.

Users can start processes from a channel, chat, or the app’s Home tab, fill out start forms in Teams, and submit to kick off workflows, with optional links to Operate for monitoring.

The integration surfaces task notifications and incidents inside Teams via tabs and bot prompts, enabling quick action and deeper investigation in Operate when needed.
