Introducing early access - a space to explore new features and components currently in development by Camunda.

Early access includes two categories of features:

## Experimental features

Experimental features are very early-stage ideas and functionalities under exploration. This allows Camunda to innovate quickly and test new concepts.

You can test out these features and provide additional feedback to help Camunda understand how they perform in real-world scenarios.

:::note
These features may be unstable, and subject to significant changes or removal.
:::

## Alpha features

[Alpha features](/components/early-access/alpha/alpha-features.md) are more developed and closer to becoming part of the product but may not yet be fully optimized or supported. Selected Camunda features and components are released as alpha versions to provide early access. By testing these features, you have the opportunity to participate in their development by sharing feedback before they reach [general availability](/reference/release-policy.md#general-availability-ga).
