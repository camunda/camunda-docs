description: "Learn how to provision element templates at runtime and make them available at design time across your Web Modeler organization and Desktop Modeler."
---

To effectively manage large libraries of reusable building blocks ([element templates](/components/concepts/element-templates.md)), you can create a pipeline that:

- Provisions the [dependencies of element templates](/components/modeler/element-templates/element-template-with-dependencies.md) to required clusters.
- Makes templates available at design time to multiple Web Modeler [shared projects](/components/modeler/web-modeler/collaboration/use-shared-project-for-organization-wide-collaboration.md) within an organization.

This guide covers conceptually what your pipeline needs to do, from obtaining credentials to runtime provisioning and template syncing.

## Prerequisites

Before building your pipeline, ensure you have the following:

For simplicity, this guide assumes:

- One organization
- One cluster
- One Web Modeler project
- A pipeline handling runtime provisioning and template syncing

## Runtime provisioning

### Secrets

You can use sensitive information in your element templates without exposing it in your BPMN processes by referencing secrets.

These guides show you how to configure them depending on the environment you are using:

- **SaaS**: Use the [Administration API](/apis-tools/administration-api/administration-api-reference.md) or [Console UI](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) to configure secrets.
- **Self-Managed/local development**: Configure secrets outside the pipeline. See [connector secrets](/self-managed/components/connectors/connectors-configuration.md#secrets).

### Job Workers

As part of the pipeline, you may spin up a service that will connect to a Camunda cluster to perform specific tasks. For example, you can use the [Spring Boot Camunda Starter](/apis-tools/camunda-spring-boot-starter/getting-started.md) to start a job worker.

Recommended resources:

- [Outbound connectors vs. job workers](/components/concepts/outbound-connectors-job-workers.md)
- [Host custom connectors](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/host-custom-connector.md)

### Other dependencies

The following dependency types are provisioned at runtime using the [Orchestration Cluster API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md):

| Dependency                                                            | Purpose                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Camunda forms](/components/modeler/forms/camunda-forms-reference.md) | Used in user tasks          |
| [RPA scripts](/components/rpa/overview.md)                            | Used in service tasks       |
| [BPMN processes](/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn.md)                    | Used in call activities     |
| [DMN decisions](/components/modeler/dmn/dmn.md)                       | Used in business rule tasks |

:::note
RPA scripts are not supported in Web Modeler
:::

To deploy dependencies, send a [POST request](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/specifications/create-deployment.api.mdx) with the files. This works for SaaS, self-managed, and local development.

For example:

```bash
curl -L 'http://localhost:8080/v2/deployments' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-F resources=@/path/to/your/form/user-signup.form
```

You will get a response containing the details of the deployed elements:

```json
{
  "deployments": [
    {
      "form": {
        "formKey": "KEY_OF_THE_FORM",
        "formId": "user-signup",
        "version": 1,
        "resourceName": "user-signup.form",
        "tenantId": "<default>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "deploymentKey": "KEY_OF_THE_DEPLOYMENT",
  "tenantId": "<default>"
}
```

When referencing a dependency such as a form, Camunda recommends using a `versionTag` as your [binding type](/components/best-practices/modeling/choosing-the-resource-binding-type.md#supported-binding-types). This option ensures the right version of the target resource is always used.

## Making templates available in Web Modeler

The pipeline can make templates available in Web Modeler using the [Web Modeler API](/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/index.md):

1. **Get project metadata**: Retrieve the project ID to know which content is available. This allows the pipeline to translate repository changes into CRUD operations.

```json title="POST /api/v1/projects/search"
{
  "filter": {
    "name": "(PROJECT NAME)"
  },
  "page": 0,
  "size": 50
}
```

Pagination is enforced for all `search` endpoints. Ensure you retrieve all relevant pages. Alternatively, a separate system of record can maintain project IDs.

2. **Get file metadata**: With the project ID, retrieve a list of files and metadata to check which repository files need to be created or updated.

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "projectId": "(PROJECT ID)"
  },
  "page": 0,
  "size": 50
}
```

3. **Create or update files**: For each repository file, execute the appropriate request based on whether it needs to be [created](https://modeler.camunda.io/swagger-ui/index.html#/Files/createFile) or [updated](https://modeler.camunda.io/swagger-ui/index.html#/Files/patchFile).
4. **Publish versions**: For each file, determine if a new version is needed and publish it to the project using the [Versions](https://modeler.camunda.io/swagger-ui/index.html#/Versions) resource. This makes the templates available to BPMN diagrams inside the project.

## Making templates available in Desktop Modeler

To set up your local environment:

- Access the VCS repository containing the templates.
- Choose how to [configure them](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/configuring-templates.md) depending on your needs. If your templates are reused across multiple projects, configuring them globally will make it easier to maintain. For project-specific templates, consider making them available only for that project to avoid exposing templates to projects that should not be using them.

:::note
If you are the template creator/maintainer, include a `README` file in your repository that lists the requirements for using your templates -- for example, which dependencies need to be provisioned in advance.
