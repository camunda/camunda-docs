description: "Integrate Legacy Applications into Camunda with RPA."
---

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) allows you to automate manual, repetitive tasks by interacting with applications directly.
Camunda uses RPA to facilitate the integration of legacy applications without accessible APIs into your process orchestration.

## Getting started

Camunda's RPA functionality is built around a standalone RPA worker and [RobotFramework](https://robotframework.org/)-based RPA scripts. This setup allows users to develop and execute RPA scripts that integrate seamlessly with existing Camunda stacks.

Check out our Quick start guide to start developing or read up on scalling your workes in a production setup.
