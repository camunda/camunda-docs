[Test a single task](../../concepts/testing.md) in Desktop Modeler.

## Prerequisites

Task testing requires a REST connection to Camunda 8.8+ cluster. gRPC connections are not supported.

When configuring a connection, make sure to **Remember credentials** or task testing won't be able to deploy the process.

## Testing a single activity

Select a task that you want to test, then go to the **Task Testing** tab in the bottom panel.

### Process variables

In the left pane, you can configure [process variables](../../concepts/variables.md) that the process instance will be started with.

As you type, the editor provides autocompletion for all the variables available in the scope, including process variables generated by your previous Task Testing executions.

### Task execution

Click the **Test Task** button to execute the selected activity. 

Your BPMN diagram will be saved, deployed and a process instance will start.

> [!Note]
> If you're working in a [process application](./process-applications.md), all its resources will be deploy.

After a process instance starts, a link to view it in Operate is provided.

Task testing will wait for the task to exit or for an incident to occur.

## Test results

After running a task, you'll see one of the following outcomes:

### Successful execution

When the task completes successfully, the results panel displays the process variables the task executed with.

### Task incident

If an incident occurs during the execution, you will see its details as well as the process variables.

### Error

If the task execution fails due to an error, you will see the response message.
