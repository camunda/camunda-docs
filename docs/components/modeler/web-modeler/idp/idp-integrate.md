Integrate your published document extraction templates into your end-to-end processes in Web Modeler.

:::tip
Not sure how to start integrating IDP? See [example IDP integration](idp-example.md) for a simple process example.
:::

## Create and configure an IDP task

You can apply a published document extraction template to a task or event via the append menu. For example:

<img src={IdpElementImg} alt="An overview of intelligent document processing" style={{width: '900px', border: 'none', padding: '0', marginTop: '0', backgroundColor: 'transparent'}} />

- **From the canvas:** Select an element and click the **Change element** icon to change an existing element, or use the append feature to add a new element to the diagram.
- **From the properties panel:** Navigate to the **Template** section and click **Select**.
- **From the side palette:** Click the **Create element** icon.

You can then configure the document extraction template in the properties panel, via the following sections:

## Input message data

### Document

Specify the document object variable used for document handling, provided as a [FEEL expression](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md) with the document reference.

For example, if you have uploaded a document via form upload using a `documents` **Key**, you can specify `documents[1]` to retrieve the first document in the array.

Example: `documents[1]`.

## Provider authentication

### Authentication

Ensure the **Credentials** AWS authentication type is selected.

### Access key

Specify your AWS _access key_ connector secret, provided as a [FEEL expression](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).

Example: `{{secrets.IDP_AWS_ACCESSKEY}}`

### Secret key

Specify your AWS _secret access key_ connector secret, provided as a [FEEL expression](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).

Example: `{{secrets.IDP_AWS_SECRETKEY}}`

## Provider configuration

### AWS S3 Bucket name

Specify the name of the Amazon S3 bucket where documents can be temporarily stored during Amazon Textract analysis as a connector secret, provided as a [FEEL expression](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).

Example: `{{secrets.IDP_AWS_BUCKET_NAME}}` (for the Amazon S3 bucket used for document storage during extraction).

:::note
The Amazon S3 bucket name must be unique across all your AWS accounts.
:::

### Region

Specify the region where documents can be temporarily stored during Amazon Textract analysis as a connector secret, provided as a [FEEL expression](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md). This should match the region where the AWS S3 bucket is located. The default region is `us-east-1`.

Example: `{{secrets.IDP_AWS_REGION}}`

## Output mapping

Specify the process variables that you want to map and export the IDP extraction connector response into.

:::info
To learn more about output mapping, see [variable/response mapping](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md#variableresponse-mapping).
:::

### Result variable

You can export the complete IDP extraction connector response (for example, the key value pairs extracted from the document) into a dedicated variable that you can then access anywhere in a process. To do this, enter a unique dedicated variable name in the **Result variable** field.

Example: `IDPResult`

### Result expression

In addition, you can choose to unpack the content of the response into multiple process variables using the **Result expression** field, as a [FEEL Context Expression](/components/concepts/expressions.md).

## Error handling

If an error occurs, the IDP extraction connector throws an error and includes the error response in the error variable in Operate.

### Error expression

You can handle an IDP extraction connector error using an Error Boundary Event and [error expressions](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md#error-expression).

## Retries

### Retries

Specify the number of [retries](/components/connectors/use-connectors/outbound.md#retries) (times) the IDP extraction connector repeats execution if it fails.

### Retry backoff

Specify a custom **Retry backoff** interval between retries instead of the default behavior of retrying immediately.

## Execution listeners

Add and manage [execution listeners](/components/concepts/execution-listeners.md) to allow users to react to events in the workflow execution lifecycle by executing custom logic.
