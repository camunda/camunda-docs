Create and manage your IDP document extraction templates in an **IDP application**.

<img src={IdpApplicationImg} alt="IDP application screen" />

## Create an IDP application

To create an IDP application:

1. In a Web Modeler project, select **Create new** > **IDP application** to open the **Create an IDP application** modal.
   <img src={IdpApplicationModalImg} alt="IDP application screen" width="550px"/>
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the IDP application.
   - **Select a cluster**: Select the cluster you want to use for modeling and testing your document extraction. Note that you cannot change the selected cluster for the IDP application once it has been created.
1. Click **Create** to create the IDP application.

1. You can now create [document extraction](idp-document-extraction.md) templates inside your IDP application folder.

<!-- 1. You can now create [document extraction](idp-document-extraction.md) and [document automation](idp-document-automation.md) projects inside your IDP application folder. -->

:::note
Camunda recommends using a development (dev) cluster for your IDP applications.

## IDP application clusters

The following requirements and limitations apply to IDP application clusters:

| Requirement/limitation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster health         | IDP applications and projects are only fully operational when linked to a healthy, active cluster. You can select an unstable or unhealthy cluster when first creating an IDP application, and change to a stable cluster once available. |
| Document handling      | When creating an IDP application folder, you can only select a cluster that supports [Camunda document handling](/components/concepts/document-handling.md). For example, the cluster must be version 8.7 or higher.                      |
| Changing cluster       | You cannot change the selected cluster once the IDP application has been created.                                                                                                                                                         |
