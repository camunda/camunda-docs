Conditional events are events triggered when a condition over process data evaluates to true.They can start, pause, or redirect a process when specific data criteria are met.

Conditional events do not rely on a separate sender. They are driven purely by FEEL expressions over process variables and are evaluated automatically when a scope starts or when relevant variables change.
