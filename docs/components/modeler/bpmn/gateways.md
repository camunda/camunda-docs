Gateways are elements that route tokens in more complex patterns than plain sequence flow.

BPMN's **exclusive gateway** chooses one sequence flow out of many based on data, whereas BPMN's **parallel gateway** generates new tokens by activating multiple sequence flows in parallel, for example.

Currently supported elements:

- [Exclusive gateways](exclusive-gateways/exclusive-gateways.md)
- [Parallel gateways](parallel-gateways/parallel-gateways.md)
- [Event-based gateways](event-based-gateways/event-based-gateways.md)
- [Inclusive gateways](inclusive-gateways/inclusive-gateways.md)
