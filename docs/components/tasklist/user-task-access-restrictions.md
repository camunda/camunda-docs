User task access restrictions allow you to ensure that only assigned or candidate [users](components/console/manage-organization/manage-users.md) and [groups](components/console/manage-organization/manage-user-groups.md) can access user tasks in [Tasklist](./introduction-to-tasklist.md). These restrictions are based on the candidate users and groups defined in a BPMN diagram.

:::info
User task access restrictions are only supported with the Tasklist v1 API. For more information, see the documentation on [Tasklist API versions](api-versions.md#user-task-access-restrictions-and-the-tasklist-api).
:::

For a user to see a task in Tasklist, they must meet one of the following criteria in the BPMN process definition:

- Be the **Assignee**.
- Be listed as a **Candidate user**.
- Belong to a **Candidate group**.

### Example use case

If a task has a candidate group named `Team A` and a candidate user named `example`, only the
users that belong to `Team A` and the user `example` will have access to the task.

### Enable/disable user task access restrictions

:::note
User task access restrictions are enabled by default on SaaS. For details on user task access restrictions in Self-Managed, visit the [Self-Managed documentation](../../self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/tasklist/user-task-access-restrictions.md).
:::

You can enable/disable user task access restrictions from the [cluster settings in Console](components/console/manage-clusters/settings.md#enforce-user-task-restrictions).

When activated, tasks assigned to users or candidate groups are only visible to the assigned user or respective group members. When deactivated, every user can see any task, regardless of the assignment.

This configuration does not affect OIDC API clients. When retrieving tasks using such a client, all tasks are returned.
