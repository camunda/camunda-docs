Use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Decision Model and Notation (DMN), and Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) in your process diagrams.

## BPMN

BPMN was developed as a graphical notation to represent complex processes. It is maintained by the non-profit The Object Management Group (OMG) and employed by numerous organizations globally. The visual nature of BPMN enables greater collaboration between different teams, particularly within Modeler.

## DMN

DMN is a modeling approach owned by an institution called the Object Management Group (OMG), which also operates worldwide standards for BPMN. In DMN, decisions are modeled and executed using a language both business analysts and developers can understand. Model a set of rules within a table, and this will yield a decision to rapidly execute a process using a decision engine like Camunda.

## FEEL expressions

FEEL is designed to write expressions in a way that is easily understood by both business professionals and developers. In Camunda, FEEL is used to define expressions in the context of BPMN diagrams, DMN diagrams, and Forms. FEEL is specified in the DMN specification of the Object Management Group (OMG).
