In addition to providing visibility into active and completed process instances, Operate also makes it possible to carry out key operations such as resolving <!-- FIXME: [incidents](/reference/incidents.html) --> incidents, and updating process instance variables.

In the [Operate User Guide](../userguide/basic-operate-navigation), learn how to use it to monitor process instances and more features.

In the [Operate Deployment Guide](../deployment/install-and-start), walk through how to install and run Operate.

Operate is also available for production use (with support) in the Camunda Cloud offering.

If you'd like try out Operate in Camunda Cloud, sign up [here](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup).

Because Operate can be a helpful tool when getting started with Zeebe and building an initial proof of concept, we make it available under [Operate Trial license](https://camunda.com/legal/terms/cloud-terms-and-conditions/general-terms-and-conditions-for-the-operate-trial-version/). There are no restrictions under this license when it comes to the length of the evaluation period or the available feature set _as long as you use Operate in non-production environments only._
