Learn how to monitor the [batch operations](../../concepts/batch-operations.md) in Camunda 8 Operate.

## Before you begin

To follow the steps in this guide, you must be [authorized to view running and completed batch operations](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/operate/userguide/access-control/#optional-authorizations).

## Monitor batch operations

1. On the **Processes** page, above the process diagram, click **View batch operations**. This opens the [**Batch Operations** page](../overview/batch-operations-overview.md).
2. To see the details of a particular batch operation, click the operation in the table. This opens the [batch operation details page](../overview/batch-operation-details-overview.md).

## View failure reasons

On the batch operation details page, if an item in the batch fails, click the arrow next to the **Process name** to expand the row and see why it failed.
