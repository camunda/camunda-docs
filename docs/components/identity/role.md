A role is a collection of [authorizations](authorization.md) that defines a set of permissions. Roles are used to grant users the system and data access they need to fulfill a certain responsibility. A role can be assigned to [users](user.md) directly or through a [group](group.md) they are a member of.

:::info
The Orchestration Cluster creates [a set of default roles](../concepts/access-control/authorizations.md#default-roles) on startup.
:::

## Create a role

To create a role:

1. Log in to Identity in your cluster, and click on the **Roles** tab.
2. Click on the **Create role** button, and provide the following role details:
   - **Role ID**: The unique identifier for the role.
   - **Role name**: The name of the role.
   - **Description**: An optional description of the role.

The role is created and can now be assigned to users or groups.
