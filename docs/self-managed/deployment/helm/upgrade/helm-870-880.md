Upgrade from Camunda 8.7 to Camunda 8.8 by upgrading the Helm chart version from 12.x to 13.x.

:::note Upgrade sequentially
Always upgrade from the latest patch of your current release to the latest patch of the next release.
Example: from 12.x.x → 13.0.1 (not 13.0.0).

Check our [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/) for available versions.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before upgrading:

| Prerequisite                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helm chart version and Helm CLI version | Determine your Helm chart version and Helm CLI version and update them to the recommended versions listed in the [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).                                                                                                                                              |
| Configuration changes                   | Ensure all required configuration changes in this guide are reviewed, understood, and implemented before running the `helm upgrade` command.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8.7 `values.yaml`                       | The approach described in this guide uses your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` file as a basis to create a new 8.8 `values.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Secret management                       | The approach described in this guide is based on the assumption that all your secrets are referenced in an existing Kubernetes secret. See [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](../configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets) for further guidance. |

## Recommended upgrade steps

The recommended approach is as follows:

1. [Create 8.8 values.yaml](#step-1-create-88-valuesyaml): Copy your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` and use it as the basis for the new 8.8 file.
1. [Update for 8.8 compatibility](#step-2-update-for-88-compatibility): Adjust the new `values.yaml` to match the changes in 8.8 and its updated architecture.
1. [Prepare and run the upgrade](#step-3-prepare-and-run-the-upgrade): Add the required upgrade-specific configuration and steps, then execute the helm upgrade command.
1. [Monitor and validate](#step-4-monitor-and-validate): Track the upgrade process and ensure all components start and function properly.

:::caution
**During the upgrade, you must keep the same overall deployment setup.** Configuration values must be updated where required for 8.8 compatibility, but architectural changes or switching authentication methods are not supported during the upgrade. For example, the same components should remain deployed, the same database connections used, and your authentication method must stay the same.
:::

## Step 1: Create 8.8 `values.yaml`

Copy your existing 8.7 values.yaml, rename it (for example, `values-8.8.yaml`), and use it as the basis for your 8.8 configuration.

:::note
Camunda 8.8 introduces major architectural and configuration changes. Using your 8.7 values.yaml as the starting point helps preserve your existing configuration wherever possible during the upgrade.
:::

## Step 2: Update for 8.8 compatibility

Go through the following sections and configure your new 8.8 `values-8.8.yaml` file to be compatible with the new 8.8 changes and architecture.

:::info Key 8.8 changes
Review [What’s new in Camunda 8.8](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88.md)  
and [Assess Camunda 8.8 changes and impact](/self-managed/update/administrators/prepare-for-update.md#step-2-assess-camunda-88-changes-and-impact) before proceeding with your upgrade from 8.7.  
:::

### Values key changes

Adjust your `values.yaml` for the 8.8 configuration changes, and double-check for any deprecated or renamed values.

### Changes to the default deployment setup

Starting with **Camunda 8.8**, the set of components deployed by default has changed compared to 8.7.  
If you want to continue deploying any of the optional components listed below, you must now enable them explicitly by setting `enabled: true` in your `values.yaml`.

- **Console** → `console.enabled: true`
- **Management Identity** → `identity.enabled: true`
- **Web Modeler** → `webModeler.enabled: true`
- **Optimize** → `optimize.enabled: true`
- **PostgreSQL (Bitnami subcharts):**
  - Identity database → `identityPostgresql.enabled: true`
  - Web Modeler database → `webModelerPostgresql.enabled: true`
- **Keycloak (Bitnami subchart)** → `identityKeycloak.enabled: true`

For more information, see [Enable additional components](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/enable-additional-components.md).

### Multi-tenancy configuration

If you previously configured **multi-tenancy** in 8.7, note that it now requires dedicated configuration within the **Orchestration Cluster** too.  
For guidance, see [Configure multi-tenancy in the Helm chart](../configure/configure-multi-tenancy.md).

### Data retention configuration

If you previously configured **data retention** in 8.7, these settings must be migrated to the new 8.8 structure:

- **Zeebe record retention**: `zeebe.retention` → `orchestration.retention`
- **Historical data retention**: Both `operate.retention` and `tasklist.retention` → `orchestration.history.retention`

In Camunda 8.8, historical data retention is unified across Operate, Tasklist, and Camunda indices under a single configuration.

For detailed configuration guidance, see [Configure data retention](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/data-retention.md).

### Migrate to combined Ingress

Starting with Camunda 8.8, the separated ingress configuration is no longer supported. Use the combined Ingress setup or replicate the previous behavior as outlined in [Configure Ingress](../configure/ingress/ingress-setup.md).

### Authentication

Make sure authentication is configured according to the following guidance:

<Tabs groupId="authentication" defaultValue="basic" queryString values={
[
{label: 'OIDC', value: 'oidc' },
{label: 'OAuth with Keycloak', value: 'keycloak' },
{label: 'Basic auth', value: 'basic' },
{label: 'LDAP', value: 'ldap' },
]}>

<TabItem value='oidc'>

For your OIDC configuration, make sure the following values are set, this is an example for entraID:

```yaml
orchestration:
  env:
  - name: CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_SCOPE_0
    value: openid
  - name: CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_SCOPE_1
    value: profile
  - name: CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_SCOPE_2
    value: offline_access
  - name: CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_SCOPE_3
    value: "<YOUR_AUDIENCE>/.default"
  - name: CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_PREFERUSERNAMECLAIM
    value: "true"
  security:
    authentication:
      method: oidc
      oidc:
        clientIdClaim: "azp"
        clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENTID>"
        secret:
          existingSecret: "<YOUR_CLIENTSECRET>"
          existingSecretKey: "<YOUR_CLIENTSECRET_KEY>"
        issuer: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<ENTRA_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize"
        audience: "<YOUR_AUDIENCE>"
        redirectUrl: "https://<YOUR_HOST>/<ORCHESTRATION_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_PATH>"
        jwksUrl: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<ENTRA_TENANT_ID>/discovery/v2.0/keys"
        tokenUrl: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<ENTRA_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token"
        # Configure on your preference for user identifier, default preferred_username
        usernameClaim: preferred_username
        # Configure on your preference for client identifier, default client_id
        clientIdClaim: client_id
        # Configure on your preference for group identifier, default groups
        groupsClaim: "groups"
        # Optional list of former operate/ tasklist/ zeebe audiences to continue to guarantee access
        backwardsCompatibleAudiences:
          - <YOUR_8.7_AUDIENCE>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='keycloak'>

For an internal setup, follow the [Internal Keycloak guide](self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md##internal-keycloak)
.
For an external Keycloak deployment, make sure your `values.yaml` is configured as described in [OpenID connect provider setup](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='basic'>

Previously, in 8.7, if basic auth was enabled, it only applied to Operate and Tasklist. With 8.8, authentication now applies to the entire Orchestration Cluster. This means you must either migrate your users to the new cluster or reconfigure them accordingly.
If you do not want to use authentication, you must explicitly disable it for Orchestration cluster; otherwise, users must be added to all requests. Ensure your `values.yaml` matches the configuration described in [Basic authentication configuration](../configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md#basic-authentication).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='ldap'>

LDAP authentication is not supported in the new 8.8 architecture.
Contact [Camunda Consulting](https://camunda.com/services/consulting/) for assistance with LDAP authentication requirements.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Step 3: Prepare and run the upgrade

### Configure migration configuration

For the migration, you must enable the **data migration** configuration. See [Data migration](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#data-migration) for details:

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    data:
      enabled: true
```

It is recommended to enable the **identity migration** to automatically migrate roles and permissions from the Management Identity to the Orchestration cluster Identity, preserving your existing authorization setup from 8.7. For more information, see [Running the Identity Migration Application](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#running-the-identity-migration-application):

<Tabs groupId="authentication" defaultValue="oidc" queryString values={
[
{label: 'OIDC', value: 'oidc' },
{label: 'OAuth with Keycloak', value: 'keycloak' },
]}>

<TabItem value='oidc'>

The Identity Migration App requires access to Management Identity. The access permission is created via a mapping rule based on the provided `claimName` and `claimValue`.
Set `claimName: oid` for Entra ID or `claimName: "sub"` for Keycloak.
The clientId and secret are required to authorize the Identity Migration App via your identity provider.

```yaml
migration:
  identity:
    enabled: true
    claimName: "<YOUR_CLAIM_NAME>"
    claimValue: "<YOUR_CLAIM_VALUE>"
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    secret:
      existingSecret: <YOUR_EXISTING_SECRET>
      existingSecretKey: <YOUR_EXISTING_SECRET_KEY>
      # only required if resource authorizations are used
    resourceAuthorizationsEnabled: true
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='keycloak'>

To authorize the Identity Migration App with your Keycloak instance, you need to create a new Kubernetes Secret.

1. Create a file named `identity-migration-secret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: identity-migration-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

2. Apply the secret to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f identity-migration-secret.yaml
```

Reference this secret in your `values-8.8.yaml` file and enable the identity migration app:

```yaml
migration:
  identity:
    enabled: true
    secret:
      # Update to match your secret name
      existingSecret: identity-migration-secret
      # Update to match your secret key
      existingSecretKey: password
    # Only required if resource authorizations are used
    resourceAuthorizationsEnabled: true
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upgrade with Helm

:::caution
If custom prefixes are used for the Camunda indices, make sure to perform the [Prefix migration](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#update-any-custom-prefixes) before proceeding.
:::

After preparing your secrets and setting the migration configuration (data, identity migration, and importers), trigger the upgrade with `helm upgrade`:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform -f values-8.8.yaml
```

## Step 4: Monitor and validate

### Monitor the upgrade

After triggering the Helm upgrade, monitor the rollout to ensure all pods return to a healthy state and the migration jobs finish successfully.

#### 1. Watch pod rollout progress

Watch the pods being migrated via:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -w
```

**What you should see:**

- Pods gradually terminate and restart with new versions.
- The Orchestration Cluster (`zeebe` StatefulSet) retains its name to prevent downtime - previous Operate and Tasklist pods will terminate.
- A `*-importer` deployment handles remaining 8.7 records.
- If both migrations are enabled, two Kubernetes Jobs run in parallel:
  - `*-zeebe-migration-data` (always present)
  - `*-zeebe-migration-identity` (optional – only if identity migration is enabled)

#### 2. Inspect migration and importer logs

```bash
# Importer deployment (migrates remaining Zeebe data)
kubectl -n <namespace> logs deploy/<importer-name> -f

# Data migration job
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<release>-zeebe-migration-data -f

# Identity migration job (if enabled)
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<release>-zeebe-migration-identity -f
```

**Expected log output:**

- Importer logs will show batches of records being imported and end with `Importer finished successfully.`
- Data migration logs contain the following [entries](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#monitor-completion-1)
- Identity migration logs contain the following [entries](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#monitor-completion)
- Once both jobs report completion, they automatically terminate with status `Complete`.

If a job is stuck in `Running` or `CrashLoopBackOff`, inspect its logs.
Wait until all pods are up and in `ready` state before continuing.

### Validate the upgrade

1. Confirm all pods are healhy:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
```

2. Confirm all pods are running on the new 8.8.x images:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{':\t'}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{'\n'}{end}{end}"
```

3. Verify access to Camunda components

- Acess Camunda components and verify users can log in with migrated roles. E.g. for the Orchestration cluster access:

```bash
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/operate
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/tasklist
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/identity
```

4. Verify workers

Verify yoru workers are still working

5. Optional: Scale down importer

Scale down the importer once confirmed idle:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> scale deploy/<importer-name> --replicas=0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrade failed due to missing secrets

The following upgrade error might be related to not having secrets as Kubernetes referenced secrets as required in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (camunda-platform/charts/identity/templates/tasklist-secret.yaml:10:22):
PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                 Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.
                 Further information can be obtained at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases

    'global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret' must not be empty, please add '--set global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret=$TASKLIST_SECRET' to the command. To get the current value:

        export TASKLIST_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "camunda" "camunda-platform-test-tasklist-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.tasklist-secret}" | base64 --decode)
```

When the Helm chart is removed or upgraded, persistent volume claims (PVCs) for secret storage are not removed or recreated. To prevent Helm from recreating secrets that have already been generated, the [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common) library chart used by Camunda blocks the upgrade path, resulting in the above error.

To complete your upgrade, [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](../configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets).
