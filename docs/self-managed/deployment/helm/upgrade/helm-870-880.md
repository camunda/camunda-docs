Upgrade from Camunda 8.7 to Camunda 8.8 by upgrading the Helm chart version from 12.x to 13.x.

:::note Upgrade sequentially
Always upgrade from the latest patch of your current release to the latest patch of the next release.
Example: from 12.x.x → 13.0.1 (not 13.0.0).
:::

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before upgrading:

| Prerequisite                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helm chart version and Helm CLI version | Determine your Helm chart version and Helm CLI version and update them to the recommended versions listed in the [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).                                                                                                                                              |
| Configuration changes                   | Ensure all required configuration changes in this guide are reviewed, understood, and implemented before running the `helm upgrade` command.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8.7 `values.yaml`                       | The approach described in this guide uses your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` file as a basis to create a new 8.8 `values.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Secret management                       | The approach described in this guide is based on the assumption that all your secrets are referenced in an existing Kubernetes secret. See [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](../configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets) for further guidance. |
| Maintenance window                      | Plan a short downtime window for the upgrade. The former Operate, Tasklist, and Zeebe Gateway deployments are replaced by the new Orchestration Cluster, which becomes available once the `zeebe` StatefulSet rollout completes.                                                                                                          |

## Recommended upgrade steps

The recommended approach is as follows:

1. [Create 8.8 values.yaml](#step-1-create-88-valuesyaml): Copy your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` and use it as the basis for the new 8.8 file.
1. [Update for 8.8 compatibility](#step-2-update-for-88-compatibility): Adjust the new `values.yaml` to match the changes in 8.8 and its updated architecture.
1. [Prepare and run the upgrade](#step-3-prepare-and-run-the-upgrade): Add the required upgrade-specific configuration and steps, then execute the helm upgrade command.
1. [Monitor and validate](#step-4-monitor-and-validate): Track the upgrade process and ensure all components start and function properly.

:::caution
**During the upgrade, you must keep the same overall deployment setup.** Configuration values must be updated where required for 8.8 compatibility, but architectural changes or switching authentication methods are not supported during the upgrade. For example, the same components should remain deployed, the same database connections used, and your authentication method must stay the same.
:::

## Step 1: Create 8.8 `values.yaml`

Copy your existing 8.7 values.yaml, rename it (for example, `values-8.8.yaml`), and use it as the basis for your 8.8 configuration.

:::note
Camunda 8.8 introduces major architectural and configuration changes. Using your 8.7 values.yaml as the starting point helps preserve your existing configuration wherever possible during the upgrade.
:::

## Step 2: Update for 8.8 compatibility

Go through the following sections and configure your new 8.8 `values.yaml` file to be compatible with the new 8.8 changes and architecture.

:::info Key 8.8 changes
Review [What’s new in Camunda 8.8](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88.md)  
and [Assess Camunda 8.8 changes and impact](/self-managed/update/administrators/prepare-for-update.md#step-2-assess-camunda-88-changes-and-impact) before proceeding with your upgrade from 8.7.  
:::

### Values key changes

Adjust your `values.yaml` for the 8.8 configuration changes, and double-check for any deprecated or renamed values, we recommend the order as defined by the following keys:

| **12.x/8.7 values.yaml**                                                                             | **13.x/8.8 values.yaml**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Changes to the default deployment setup

Starting with Camunda 8.8, the set of components deployed by default has changed compared to 8.7.  
If you used any of the components listed below, you must now enable them explicitly to ensure they are present after the upgrade.

| Component disabled by default with 13.x/8.8.x                                                                         | 13.x/8.8.x key to enable it                                                                            |

For more information, see [Enable additional components](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/enable-additional-components.md).

### Multi-tenancy configuration

If you previously configured Multi-tenancy in 8.7, note that it now requires additional configuration for the Orchestration Cluster (`orchestration.*`). For guidance, see [Configure multi-tenancy in the Helm chart](../configure/configure-multi-tenancy.md#parameters).

### Migrate to combined Ingress

Starting with Camunda 8.8, the separated ingress configuration is no longer supported. Use the combined Ingress setup or replicate the previous behavior as outlined in [Configure Ingress](../configure/ingress/ingress-setup.md).

### Authentication

Make sure authentication is configured according to the following guidance:

<Tabs groupId="authentication" defaultValue="basic" queryString values={
[
{label: 'OIDC', value: 'oidc' },
{label: 'OAuth with Keycloak', value: 'keycloak' },
{label: 'Basic auth', value: 'basic' },
{label: 'LDAP', value: 'ldap' },
]}>

<TabItem value='oidc'>

For your OIDC configuration, make sure at least the following keys are set, this is an example for [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity):

```yaml
global:
  security:
    authentication:
      method: oidc
orchestration:
  security:
    authentication:
      oidc:
        # :start: relocated from former `global.identity.auth.zeebe`
        clientId: <YOUR_CLIENTID>
        secret:
          existingSecret: <YOUR_CLIENTSECRET>
          existingSecretKey: <YOUR_CLIENTSECRET_KEY>
        audience: <YOUR_AUDIENCE>
        # :end: relocated from former `global.identity.auth.zeebe`
        redirectUrl: https://<YOUR_PUBLIC_HOST>{{ .Values.orchestration.contextPath }}
        # Configure the claim in the access token to identify a client, default: client_id
        clientIdClaim: azp
        # Configure the claim in the access token to identify a user by, default: preferred_username
        usernameClaim: preferred_username
        # Configure the claim in the access token to retrieve groups from, default: groups
        groupsClaim: groups
        # For Microsoft Entra ID the following scopes are required
        scope:
          - openid
          - profile
          - offline_access
          - <YOUR_AUDIENCE>/.default
        # In case of Microsoft Entra ID, a user acces token contains `azp` and `preferred_username` thus the username claim needs to be preferred
        preferUsernameClaim: true
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='keycloak'>

### Internal Keycloak

```yaml
global:
  security:
    authentication:
      method: oidc
orchestration:
  security:
    authentication:
      method: oidc
      oidc:
        secret:
          existingSecret: <YOUR_CLIENTSECRET>
          existingSecretKey: <YOUR_CLIENTSECRET_KEY>
  redirectUrl: https://<YOUR_PUBLIC_HOST>{{ .Values.orchestration.contextPath }}
```

For more details, follow the [Internal Keycloak guide](self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md##internal-keycloak)
.
For an external Keycloak deployment, make sure your `values.yaml` is configured as described in [OpenID connect provider setup](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md).

:::warning

In the Camunda 8.7 Helm chart, Keycloak has been upgraded to version `26.3.3`, which introduces changes to environment variable prefixes.  
Some variables previously using the `KEYCLOAK_` prefix now use `KC_`.

For details, see the [Keycloak release notes](https://github.com/camunda/keycloak/releases/tag/2025-09-16-001).

Update the prefix for any affected environment variables in your configuration.
No action is required if you don’t use custom variables passed to the Keycloak deployment (for example, via the values file or post-rendering).

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='basic'>

Previously, in 8.7, if basic auth was enabled, it only applied to Operate and Tasklist. With 8.8, authentication now applies to the entire Orchestration Cluster. This means you must either migrate your users to the new cluster or reconfigure them accordingly.
If you do not want to use authentication, you must explicitly disable it for Orchestration cluster; otherwise, users must be added to all requests. Ensure your `values.yaml` matches the configuration described in [Basic authentication configuration](../configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md#basic-authentication).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='ldap'>

LDAP authentication is not supported in the new 8.8 architecture.
Contact [Camunda Consulting](https://camunda.com/services/consulting/) for assistance with LDAP authentication requirements.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Step 3: Prepare and run the upgrade

Add required upgrade-specific configuration.

### Data migration

For the migration, you must enable the **data migration** configuration. See [Data migration](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#data-migration) for details:

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    data:
      enabled: true
```

### Identity migration

It is recommended to enable the **identity migration** to automatically migrate your permissions setup from Management Identity into the Orchestration cluster Identity, preserving your existing authorization setup from 8.7. For further insights, see [Running the Identity Migration Application](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#running-the-identity-migration-application):

<Tabs groupId="authentication" defaultValue="oidc" queryString values={
[
{label: 'OIDC', value: 'oidc' },
{label: 'OAuth with Keycloak', value: 'keycloak' },
]}>

<TabItem value='oidc'>

The Identity Migration App requires `read` access to Management Identity.

You thus either need to create or reuse existing client credentials with the `read` permission for the Management Identity API and provide the corresponding `clientId` and `secret` for it.

1. Create a file named `identity-migration-secret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: identity-migration-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: "WU9VUl9QQVNTV09SRA==" # base64 encoded YOUR_PASSWORD
```

2. Apply the secret to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f identity-migration-secret.yaml
```

Reference this secret in your `values-8.8.yaml` file and enable the identity migration app.
You can rely on an automatically created Mapping Rule for that client by providing a `claimName` and `claimValue` to authorize the client for the Management Identity API.

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    identity:
      enabled: true
      # In case of Microsoft Entra ID, you can use the `azp` claim that contains the client_id value
      claimName: azp
      claimValue: <YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID>
      clientId: <YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID>
      secret:
        existingSecret: identity-migration-secret
        existingSecretKey: password
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='keycloak'>

To authorize the Identity Migration App with your Keycloak instance, you need to create a new Kubernetes Secret.

1. Create a file named `identity-migration-secret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: identity-migration-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: "WU9VUl9QQVNTV09SRA==" # base64 encoded YOUR_PASSWORD
```

2. Apply the secret to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f identity-migration-secret.yaml
```

Reference this secret in your `values-8.8.yaml` file and enable the identity migration app:

:::info
The Helm chart creates a dedicated Keycloak client with read-only access to your Identity Resource Server. If you override your Identity clients, follow the Helm chart section in [Common configuration for the Identity Migration application](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#common-configuration-for-the-identity-migration-application) to set up the required `migration` client.
:::

```yaml
migration:
  identity:
    enabled: true
    secret:
      existingSecret: identity-migration-secret
      existingSecretKey: password
    # Only required if resource authorizations are used
    resourceAuthorizationsEnabled: true
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upgrade with Helm

:::caution
If custom prefixes are used for the Camunda indices, make sure to perform the [Prefix migration](../../../components/components-upgrade/870-to-880.md#update-any-custom-prefixes) before proceeding.
:::

After preparing your secrets and setting the migration configuration (data, identity migration, and importers), trigger the upgrade with `helm upgrade`:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform -f values-8.8.yaml
```

## Step 4: Monitor and validate

### Monitor the upgrade

After triggering the Helm upgrade, monitor the rollout to ensure all pods return to a healthy state and the migration jobs finish successfully.

#### 1. Watch pod rollout progress

Watch the pods being migrated via:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -w
```

**What you should see:**

- Pods gradually terminate and restart with new versions.
- The Orchestration Cluster (`zeebe` StatefulSet) retains its name to prevent downtime - previous Operate and Tasklist pods will terminate.
- A `*-importer` deployment handles remaining 8.7 records.
- If both migrations are enabled, two Kubernetes Jobs run in parallel:
  - `*-zeebe-migration-data` (always present)
  - `*-zeebe-migration-identity` (optional – only if identity migration is enabled)

#### 2. Inspect migration and importer logs

```bash
# Importer deployment (migrates remaining Zeebe data)
kubectl -n <namespace> logs deploy/<importer-name> -f

# Data migration job
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<release>-zeebe-migration-data -f

# Identity migration job (if enabled)
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<release>-zeebe-migration-identity -f
```

If a job is stuck in `Running` or `CrashLoopBackOff`, inspect its logs.
Wait until all pods are up and in `ready` state before continuing. If the job stops retrying, see [Migration job did not complete](#migration-job-did-not-complete).

### Validate the upgrade

1. Confirm all pods are healhy:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
```

2. Confirm all pods are running on the new 8.8.x images:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{':\t'}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{'\n'}{end}{end}"
```

3. Verify access to Camunda components

- Acess Camunda components and verify users can log in with migrated roles. E.g. for the Orchestration cluster access:

```bash
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/operate
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/tasklist
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/identity
```

4. Verify workers

If you’re running external workers for Camunda processes, ensure they are still connected and actively processing tasks after the migration.

## Troubleshooting

### Migration job did not complete

If the migration job (for data or identity) fails to complete and eventually stops retrying, it likely hit its `backoffLimit` (the maximum number of retry attempts).
This usually happens when the importer job wasn’t finsihing yet before the jobs stops.

How to fix this:

1. Check the job status

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get jobs
```

2. Delete the failed migration jobs

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> delete job camunda-zeebe-migration-data
kubectl -n <namespace> delete job camunda-zeebe-migration-identity
```

3. Rerun your [Helm upgrade command](#upgrade-with-helm) to recreate and restart the migration jobs:

### Upgrade failed due to missing secrets

The following upgrade error might be related to not having secrets as Kubernetes referenced secrets as required in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (camunda-platform/charts/identity/templates/tasklist-secret.yaml:10:22):
PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                 Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.
                 Further information can be obtained at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases

    'global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret' must not be empty, please add '--set global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret=$TASKLIST_SECRET' to the command. To get the current value:

        export TASKLIST_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "camunda" "camunda-platform-test-tasklist-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.tasklist-secret}" | base64 --decode)
```

When the Helm chart is removed or upgraded, persistent volume claims (PVCs) for secret storage are not removed or recreated. To prevent Helm from recreating secrets that have already been generated, the [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common) library chart used by Camunda blocks the upgrade path, resulting in the above error.

To complete your upgrade, [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](../configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets).
