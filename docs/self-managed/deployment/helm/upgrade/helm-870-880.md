---

Upgrade from Camunda 8.7 to Camunda 8.8 by upgrading the Helm chart version from 12.x to 13.x.

:::tip Upgrade sequentially
Always upgrade from the latest patch of your current release → to the latest patch of the next release.

Example: from 12.x.x → 13.0.1 (not 13.0.0).

Check our [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/) for available versions.
:::

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before upgrading:

| Prerequisite                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helm chart version and Helm CLI version | Determine your Helm chart version and Helm CLI version and update them to the recommended versions listed in the [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/). |
| Configuration changes                   | Ensure all required configuration changes in this guide are reviewed, understood, and implemented before running the `helm upgrade` command.                                                 |
| 8.7 `values.yaml`                       | The approach described in this guide uses your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` file as a basis to create a new 8.8 `values.yaml`.                                                                 |

## Recommended upgrade steps

The recommended approach is as follows:

1. [Create 8.8 values.yaml](#step-1-create-88-valuesyaml): Copy your existing 8.7 `values.yaml` and use it as the basis for the new 8.8 file.
1. [Update for 8.8 compatibility](#step-2-update-for-8.8-compatibility): Adjust the new `values.yaml` to match the changes in 8.8 and its updated architecture.
1. [Prepare and run the upgrade](#step-3-prepare-and-run-the-upgrade): Add the required upgrade-specific configuration and steps, then execute the helm upgrade command.
1. [Monitor and validate](#step-4-monitor-and-validate): Track the upgrade process and ensure all components start and function properly.

:::caution
**During the upgrade, you must keep the same overall deployment setup.** Configuration values must be updated where required for 8.8 compatibility, but architectural changes or switching authentication methods are not supported during the upgrade. For example, the same components should remain deployed, the same database connections used, and your authentication method must stay the same.
:::

## Step 1: Create 8.8 `values.yaml`

Copy your existing 8.7 values.yaml, rename it (for example, `values-8.8.yaml`), and use it as the basis for your 8.8 configuration.

:::note
Camunda 8.8 introduces major architectural and configuration changes. Using your 8.7 values.yaml as the starting point helps preserve your existing configuration wherever possible during the upgrade.
:::

## Step 2: Update for 8.8 compatibility

Go through the following sections and configure your new 8.8 `values-8.8.yaml` file to be compatible with the new 8.8 changes and architecture.

:::info Key 8.8 changes
Review [What’s new in Camunda 8.8](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88.md)  
and [Assess Camunda 8.8 changes and impact](/self-managed/update/administrators/prepare-for-update.md#step-2-assess-camunda-88-changes-and-impact) before proceeding with your upgrade from 8.7.  
:::

### Overview of major changes

The following architectural and deployment changes related to the Helm Charts must be reviewed before upgrading:

| Change                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application consolidation**      | Zeebe, Zeebe Gateway, Operate, and Tasklist are consolidated into a single deployment artifact called the [Orchestration Cluster](/reference/glossary.md#orchestration-cluster).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Changed default deployment**     | By default, Camunda 8.8 deploys only the **Orchestration Cluster**, **Connectors**, and the **Bitnami Elasticsearch subchart**.<ul><li>The Orchestration Cluster keeps the StatefulSet name `zeebe` to avoid downtime.</li><li>All other applications must be explicitly enabled in `values.yaml`.</li><li>Per-application secondary storage retention is no longer supported.</li></ul> |
| **Operate and Tasklist Importers** | 8.7 Operate and Tasklist importers are deployed as one importer deployment in 8.8 for the migration.<ul><li>They remain idle once migration is complete.</li><li>You can scale them down manually.</li><li>They will be removed entirely in 8.9.</li></ul>                                                                                                                               |
| **Resource requirements**          | Resource allocation may need adjustment for the new Orchestration Cluster deployment. It’s recommended to run a load test simulating production traffic to ensure your cluster sizing is appropriate before upgrading your production environment.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Kubernetes migration jobs**      | Two Helm-based Kubernetes jobs support the migration:<ul><li>[Identity migration](#identity-migration)</li><li>[Data migration](<#data-migration-(required)>)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**       | Running dedicated Elasticsearch or OpenSearch clusters per app is no longer supported; only a shared cluster is allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Metrics**                        | Application metrics have been updated in 8.8; review and adapt your monitoring setup accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Multitenancy**                   | A new configuration model is introduced. See [Configure multi-tenancy in Helm chart](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/configure-multi-tenancy.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Retention**                      | Due to application consolidation, retention configuration per application is no longer supported. Retention policies must now be configured on Orchestration cluster level.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Ingress**                        | Starting with Camunda 8.8, the separated Ingress configuration is no longer supported. Use the combined Ingress setup, or replicate the previous behavior as outlined in [Configure Ingress](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/ingress/ingress-setup.md).                                                                                                                          |

### Ensure required components

In 8.8, the default set of deployed components is different from 8.7 and you must select the Camunda components you want to deploy. The following components are **enabled by default**:

- Orchestration Cluster
- Connectors
- Elasticsearch (Bitnami subchart)

All other components **must be explicitly enabled** in your `values.yaml` if you need them:

- Console
- Management Identity
- Web Modeler
- Optimize
- PostgreSQL (Bitnami subchart)
- Keycloak (Bitnami subchart)

:::tip Enable components you need
For detailed instructions on enabling each component, including configuration requirements and dependencies, see [Enable additional components](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/enable-additional-components.md).

**Important:** Management Identity is required for Web Modeler, Console, and Optimize to function properly.
:::

**Note:** Because of Bitnami's support policy changes, Camunda now uses enterprise images. For more details and usage, see [Bitnami enterprise images](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/registry-and-images/install-bitnami-enterprise-images.md). From 8.8 onwards, Bitnami subcharts for Keycloak and PostgreSQL are disabled.

### Authentication

Make sure authentication is configured according to the following guidance:

#### Basic auth

Previously, in 8.7, if basic auth was enabled, it only applied to Operate and Tasklist. With 8.8, authentication now applies to the entire Orchestration Cluster. This means you must either migrate your users to the new cluster or reconfigure them accordingly.
If you do not want to use authentication, you must explicitly disable it for Orchestration cluster; otherwise, users must be added to all requests. Ensure your `values.yaml` matches the configuration described in [Basic authentication configuration](../configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md#basic-authentication).

#### OIDC

Ensure your `values.yaml` is configured according to the [OIDC guide](../configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md#external-identity-provider).

#### OAuth (Keycloak)

For an internal setup, follow the [Internal Keycloak guide](self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/index.md##internal-keycloak)
.
For an external Keycloak deployment, make sure your `values.yaml` is configured as described in [OpenID connect provider setup](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md).

#### LDAP

No migration path is available. Please contact Camunda Consulting for support.

### Migrate secrets to new format

Review the new [secret conventions](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/secret-management.md) in 8.8 and upgrade your secrets accordingly.

### Migrate to combined Ingress

Starting with Camunda 8.8, the separated ingress configuration is no longer supported. Use the combined Ingress setup, or replicate the previous behavior as outlined in [Configure Ingress](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/ingress/ingress-setup.md).

### Multi-tenancy configuration

If you used multi-tenancy in 8.7, be aware that a new configuration model is introduced in 8.8. See [Configure multi-tenancy in Helm chart](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/configure-multi-tenancy.md) for details.

### Values key changes

Adjust your `values.yaml` for the 8.8 configuration changes, and double-check for any deprecated or renamed values.

| **Old key**     | **New key**            | **Notes** |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| **Web Modeler** |                        |           |
| `postgresql`    | `webModelerPostgresql` |           |

The consolidation of `Zeebe`, `Zeebe Gateway`, `Operate`, and `Tasklist` into the new `Orchestration Cluster` requires three types of changes:

#### Renamed keys - update references directly

Rename the top-level key `zeebe` to `orchestration`. Sub-keys remain the same.

| **Old key** | **New key**     | **Notes** |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **Zeebe**   |                 |           |
| `zeebe`     | `orchestration` |           |

#### Relocated keys - move under orchestration

The following keys should be moved from the old components to `orchestration`.

| **Old key**                         | **New key**                                  | **Notes**             |

| **Tasklist**                        |                                              |                       |
| `tasklist.enabled`                  | `orchestration.profiles.tasklist`            |                       |

**Relocated keys - move under Connectors**

The following keys should be moved from global to `connectors`.

| **Old key**                        | **New key**                               | **Notes**             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Global Identity Authintecation** |                                           |                       |
| `global.identity.auth.connectors`  | `connectors.security.authentication.oidc` | ⚠️ Different key name |

#### Merged keys - manually consolidate

These keys existed separately across components. They must now be combined under `orchestration`. If you use them, review carefully, as most accept free-form input.

| `tasklist.extraVolumeMounts`      |                                    |           |

It is highly recommended to migrate to the new orchestration values structure. However, the Camunda 8.8 Helm chart (13.x.x) provides a compatibility layer, so configurations using the old structure from Camunda 8.7 (12.x.x) will still work. Enable the compatibility layer with:

```yaml
global:
  compatibility:
    orchestration:
      enabled: true
```

:::important Validate your new values.yaml
Before proceeding with the real upgrade, its strongly recommended to validate your new `values-8.8.yaml` with a **greenfield installation**.  
This ensures your configuration is compatible with 8.8 and avoids having configuration issues on upgrade.

⚠️ **Important:** When performing this test installation, do **not** reuse your production resources.  
Make sure to point the test installation to separate infrastructure (e.g., secrets, databases) so your production system remains unaffected.

```bash
helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
helm repo update

helm install camunda camunda/camunda-platform \
  --version 8.8.x \
  -f values-8.8.yaml
```

Run `kubectl get pods` and confirm that all pods are in the Running state.
Once the test installation is successful, continue with Step [3: Prepare and run the upgrade](#step-3-prepare-and-run-the-upgrade) below.
:::

## Step 3: Prepare and run the upgrade

### Enable importer (required)

To finish processing existing 8.7 data prior to the migration, you must deploy the 8.7 importers.
Without them, the migration cannot begin.
Once the migration is complete, you can either disable the importers or leave them idle.

```yaml
orchestration:
  importer:
    enabled: true
```

### Data migration (required)

The Data Migration app is mandatory when upgrading from Camunda 8.7.
It upgrades process data storage from the old 8.7 indices (tasklist-process, operate-process) to the new unified operate-process index in 8.8.

:::warning Important
Only supported when upgrading from 8.7 (not on fresh 8.8 installs).
Can run only once.
Requires that 8.7 already has process data; otherwise the job will fail.
:::

Enable process migration in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    data:
      enabled: true
```

This creates a Kubernetes job and enables the Tasklist and Operate importers, which are necessary for migration to complete.

To confirm success, check the job logs or Prometheus metric:

- `camunda_migration_processes_migrated` — should equal the number of documents in the operate-process index.

### Identity migration (optional)

The Identity Migration app lets you move data from Management Identity (8.7) to the new Orchestration Cluster Identity (8.8).
It is recommended to run the migration so your users and authorizations are transferred automatically.
If you skip it, you’ll need to set up all authorizations manually in the new cluster.

When using the migration app, keep the following in mind:

- It runs as a Kubernetes job.
- It is idempotent, meaning you can safely rerun it without creating duplicates.
- Both Keycloak and OIDC (e.g. Entra ID) are supported.
- Migrates roles, groups, tenants, users, and their assignments.
- if [resource authorizations](../../../../../versioned_docs/version-8.7/self-managed/identity/access-management/resource-authorizations.md) are used, you must enable the following to take your resource authorizations into account:

```yaml
orchestration.migration.identity.resourceAuthorizationsEnabled: true
```

- After a successful migration, you can delete the job, ConfigMap, and created migration client.

#### Keycloak

If you are using the internal Keycloak component that is provided by the Helm chart, the following entities will be migrated:

1. Roles and their permissions
2. Group relationships
3. Group members/users
4. Group role assignments (dependent on roles being migrated)
5. Group resource authorizations
6. User role assignments (dependent on roles being migrated)
7. Applications
8. Tenants (dependent on roles)

#### OIDC (OpenID Connect)

If you are using an external identity provider, such as Microsoft Entra ID, the following entities will be migrated:

- Roles
- Tenants
- Mappings

#### Enable identity migration

Enable the identity migration in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    identity:
      enabled: true
      idpApplicationId: "your-id" # only required if you are using OIDC (OpenID Connect)
```

### Multi-region migration

If you are upgrading a dual-region deployment, the upgrade steps in this guide as well as the components upgrade guide apply. The following are additional configuration considerations for multi-region (dual-region) setups.

:::info
Multi-region deployments, as outlined in our [reference](/self-managed/deployment/helm/cloud-providers/amazon/amazon-eks/dual-region.md), require manual exporter configuration. Follow the additional steps below in addition to the standard upgrade process outlined in this guide.
:::

#### Required configuration changes

The following table outlines configuration changes specific to multi-region deployments on a high-level:

| Configuration area        | Change required                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exporter keys**         | Update `global.elasticsearch.disableExporter: false` | Replace with `orchestration.exporters.camunda.enabled: false` and `orchestration.exporters.zeebe.enabled: false`                                                              |
| **New Camunda Exporter**  | Define for both regions                              | Configure the new [Camunda Exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md)                                                |
| **Legacy Exporter**       | Retain during migration                              | Keep the old [Elasticsearch / OpenSearch Exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md) definitions                      |
| **Environment variables** | Update gateway prefixes                              | Change `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_*` to `ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_*` (embedded gateway architecture)                                                                                          |
| **Message compression**   | Add to orchestration config                          | Required for migration jobs to communicate with the Zeebe cluster                                                                                                             |
| **Basic auth users**      | Migrate manually                                     | Users defined in `camunda.operate` or `camunda.tasklist` require manual migration to [embedded Identity](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/identity/overview.md) |
| **API security**          | Review defaults                                      | gRPC and REST APIs are secured by default in 8.8                                                                                                                              |

#### Configure exporters for both regions

Define the new Camunda Exporter for each region while retaining legacy exporters during migration. See the [Camunda Exporter documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md) for authentication and additional configuration options.

**Keep existing 8.7 exporters** (for example, `ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_ELASTICSEARCHREGION0_CLASSNAME`) and **add new Camunda exporters**:

```yaml
orchestration:
  # Allows us to define our own exporters
  exporters:
    camunda:
      enabled: false
    zeebe:
      enabled: false
  env:
    # Existing 8.7 exporters - keep for migration
    # ...

    # New Region 0 Camunda Exporter
    - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAREGION0_CLASSNAME
      value: io.camunda.exporter.CamundaExporter
    - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAREGION0_ARGS_CONNECT_URL
      value: PLACEHOLDER
    # New Region 1 Camunda Exporter
    - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAREGION1_CLASSNAME
      value: io.camunda.exporter.CamundaExporter
    - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAREGION1_ARGS_CONNECT_URL
      value: PLACEHOLDER
```

The `PLACEHOLDER` should be replaced with the same value that is currently used by `ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_ELASTICSEARCHREGION0_ARGS_CONNECT_URL` and `ELASTICSEARCHREGION1` respectively.

#### Update environment variable naming

Due to the new 8.8 architecture, the Zeebe Gateway is now embedded with the Orchestration Cluster and not standalone anymore. Environment variable prefixes have changed:

- **Old prefix:** `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_*`
- **New prefix:** `ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_*`

**Example:** `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_MESSAGECOMPRESSION` becomes `ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_MESSAGECOMPRESSION`

:::caution Message compression during migration
If your multi-region setup uses cluster message compression (standard practice), you must configure it in the `orchestration.env` section to apply to the migration jobs to function properly. Migration jobs use a standalone gateway and require the original `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_MESSAGECOMPRESSION` variable to communicate with the Zeebe cluster.
:::

#### Enable migration components

Follow the [Data migration](#data-migration-required) and [Importer](#enable-importer-required) sections of this guide, ensuring migration components are enabled:

```yaml
orchestration:
  migration:
    data:
      enabled: true
  importer:
    enabled: true
```

#### Handle authentication changes

Basic authentication now applies to the entire Orchestration Cluster. If you previously defined users in `camunda.operate.userId` or `camunda.tasklist.userId` within the `applications.yaml` of each component:

1. Manually migrate users to the new [embedded Identity](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/identity/overview.md).
2. Configure initial users to avoid falling back to `demo:demo` credentials.
3. Review the [Authentication](#authentication) section of this guide.

**API security defaults:** gRPC and REST APIs are secured by default in 8.8. To restore previous behavior:

```yaml
orchestration:
  security:
    authentication:
      unprotectedApi: false
    authorizations:
      enabled: false
```

#### Reference configuration example

See the [example values.yaml](https://github.com/camunda/c8-multi-region/blob/main/aws/dual-region/kubernetes/camunda-values-migration.yml) containing 8.7 to 8.8 changes with migration enabled for multi-region deployments.

#### Multi-region specific considerations

Since every setup can differ, here are some edge cases to consider when upgrading multi-region deployments:

- **Identity migration (if using Identity):**
  Enable [Identity migration](#identity-migration-optional) in **only one region**. The stretched Zeebe cluster requires the migration to run a single time.
  Make sure to make yourself familiar with the [migration of secrets](#migrate-secrets-to-new-format).

- **Helm-managed exporters (if using a single secondary storage):**
  When using one external secondary storage instead of two and use the Helm chart managed exporter, consider enabling following to ensure the automatic creation:
  - Set `orchestration.exporters.zeebe.enabled: true` and `orchestration.exporters.camunda.enabled: true`.
  - Deploy the data migration and importer in **only one region**, keeping them disabled elsewhere.

- **Optimize deployment (if Optimize is used alongside Identity):**
  Keep the old Elasticsearch exporter enabled after migration, as Optimize does not yet support the Camunda Exporter.

#### Post successful Migration

If you're not using Optimize, disable the old (legacy Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) exporter via the [Zeebe Management API](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/operations/management-api.md) and then remove its configuration from your `values.yaml`.

Make sure to make yourself familiar with the updated [operational procedure for dual-region](/self-managed/deployment/helm/operational-tasks/dual-region-ops.md).

### Recommended migration configuration

This example shows a full 8.8 values.yaml migration setup. While data migration and importers are required for a successful upgrade from 8.7, it’s recommended to enable all migration components:

```yaml
orchestration:
  importer:
    enabled: true
  migration:
    identity:
      enabled: true
      idpApplicationId: "your-id" # only required if you are using OIDC (OpenID Connect)
      resourceAuthorizationsEnabled: true # only required if resource authorizations are used
    data:
      enabled: true
```

### Prepare secrets for upgrade

This step is not required if your `values.yaml` already references Kubernetes secrets (not plaintext literals). In that case, no changes are needed - just ensure each secret.name points to the correct Kubernetes secret.

If you deployed Management Identity in 8.7 and either:

- relied on the chart’s autogenerated secrets (including Keycloak), or
- defined your secrets as inline values in `values.yaml` (plaintext literals),

then you must extract the current values, store them as Kubernetes Secrets, and reference them in your `values.yaml` to upgrade to 8.8 successfully (see guidance below).

:::note
“inline values (plaintext literals)” refers to secrets written directly as plaintext in your `values.yaml`, similar to Kubernetes --from-literal secrets. See the [Kubernete secret documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#create-a-secret-using-kubectl-create-secret) for details.
:::

**What you need to do**

1. Extract current secret values from your 8.7 secrets.
1. Create a consolidated Kubernetes Secret (e.g., camunda-credentials).
1. Reference those keys in a values file used by 8.8.

The following is a working example - you can follow it as-is, or adapt it with your own secret names, manifests, or scripts.

:::caution
The list below shows secrets typically autogenerated by the Helm chart; the exact set depends on enabled components. For example, if you use an external Keycloak, remove the Keycloak-related items, etc.

Do not change or regenerate secrets during the upgrade. Reusing the same values preserves Identity and authentication data.
:::

#### 1. Extraction

```shell
NOTE: All Helm chart values mentioned here are based on the 8.7 syntax, as the upgrade has not happened yet.

# Change this according to your Helm chart release/deployment name and namespace.
RELEASE_NAME=camunda-dev
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=camunda-dev

# "global.identity.auth.enabled: true" is assumed for all "IDENTITY_*_CLIENT_SECRET" values.

# Only if "connectors.enabled: true".
export IDENTITY_CONNECTORS_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-connectors-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.connectors-secret}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "console.enabled: true".
export IDENTITY_CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-console-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.console-secret}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "optimize.enabled: true".
export IDENTITY_OPTIMIZE_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-optimize-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.optimize-secret}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "zeebe.enabled: true".
export IDENTITY_ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-zeebe-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.zeebe-secret}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "postgresql.enabled: true".
export WEB_MODELER_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-postgresql-web-modeler" -o jsonpath="{.data.postgres-password}" | base64 --decode)
export WEB_MODELER_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-postgresql-web-modeler" -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "identityPostgresql.enabled: true".
export IDENTITY_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-identity-postgresql" -o jsonpath="{.data.postgres-password}" | base64 --decode)
export IDENTITY_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-identity-postgresql" -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "identityKeycloak.enabled: true".
export KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-keycloak" -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode)

# Only if "identityKeycloak.postgresql.enabled: true".
export KEYCLOAK_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-postgresql" -o jsonpath="{.data.postgres-password}" | base64 --decode)
export KEYCLOAK_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret "${RELEASE_NAME}-postgresql" -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode)
```

#### 2. Creation

Template a consolidated Secret manifest containing all keys you’ll reuse in 8.8:

```shell
cat << EOF >> existing-secrets-manifest.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: camunda-credentials
  namespace: "${RELEASE_NAMESPACE}"
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # Only if "connectors.enabled: true".
  identity-connectors-client-token: "${IDENTITY_CONNECTORS_CLIENT_SECRET}"

  # Only if "console.enabled: true".
  identity-console-client-token: "${IDENTITY_CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET}"

  # Only if "optimize.enabled: true".
  identity-optimize-client-token: "${IDENTITY_OPTIMIZE_CLIENT_SECRET}"

  # Only if "orchestration.enabled: true".
  identity-orchestration-client-token: "${IDENTITY_ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECRET}"

  # Only if "identityPostgresql.enabled: true".
  identity-postgresql-admin-password: "${IDENTITY_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET}"
  identity-postgresql-user-password: "${IDENTITY_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET}"

  # Only if "keycloak.enabled: true".
  identity-keycloak-admin-password: "${KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_SECRET}"

  # Only if "keycloak.postgresql.enabled: true".
  identity-keycloak-postgresql-admin-password: "${KEYCLOAK_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET}"
  identity-keycloak-postgresql-user-password: "${KEYCLOAK_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET}"

  # Only if "postgresql.enabled: true".
  webmodeler-postgresql-admin-password: "${WEB_MODELER_POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_SECRET}"
  webmodeler-postgresql-user-password: "${WEB_MODELER_POSTGRESQL_USER_SECRET}"
EOF
```

Inspect and apply:

Review `existing-secrets-manifest.yaml` and ensure it contains exactly the secrets for the components enabled in your 8.7 deployment.

```shell
kubectl apply -n "${RELEASE_NAMESPACE}" -f existing-secrets-manifest.yaml
```

#### 3. Referencing

Reference the new Secret and keys in a values file for your 8.8 deployment. You can either update your 8.8 `values.yaml` or create a separate file (for example, `existing-secrets-values.yaml`) and include it during the Helm upgrade.

:::caution
If a component already uses its own existing secret, make sure to remove that section from the configuration to avoid overriding it.
:::

```yaml
# existing-secrets-values.yaml
global:
  identity:
    auth:
      console:
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
          existingSecretKey: "identity-console-client-token"
      optimize:
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
          existingSecretKey: "identity-optimize-client-token"

identityPostgresql:
  auth:
    existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
    secretKeys:
      adminPasswordKey: "identity-postgresql-admin-password"
      userPasswordKey: "identity-postgresql-user-password"

identityKeycloak:
  auth:
    existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
    passwordSecretKey: "identity-keycloak-admin-password"
  postgresql:

connectors:
  security:
    authentication:
      oidc:
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
          existingSecretKey: "identity-connectors-client-token"

orchestration:
  security:
    authentication:
      oidc:
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
          existingSecretKey: "identity-orchestration-client-token"
```

### Upgrade with Helm

After preparing your secrets and setting the migration configuration (data, identity migration, and importers), trigger the upgrade with `helm upgrade`.

If you extracted secrets into a separate file (e.g., `existing-secrets-values.yaml`), include it alongside your main values file:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform \
    -f values-8.8.yaml \
    -f existing-secrets-values.yaml
```

If your secrets are already referenced directly in your values-8.8.yaml, you can omit the extra file and just run:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform \
    -f values-8.8.yaml
```

## Step 4: Monitor and validate

### Monitor the upgrade

Monitor the Helm job logs (`identity-migration`, `process-application-migration`).

### Validate the upgrade

Confirm the migration has finished by checking application logs and readiness status.

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrade failed due to missing secrets

The following upgrade error is related to [secrets extraction](#extract-secrets):

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (camunda-platform/charts/identity/templates/tasklist-secret.yaml:10:22):
PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                 Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.
                 Further information can be obtained at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases

    'global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret' must not be empty, please add '--set global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret=$TASKLIST_SECRET' to the command. To get the current value:

```

When the Helm chart is removed or upgraded, persistent volume claims (PVCs) for secret storage are not removed or recreated. To prevent Helm from recreating secrets that have already been generated, the [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common) library chart used by Camunda blocks the upgrade path, resulting in the above error.

To complete your upgrade, [extract your secrets](#extract-secrets) and provide them as environment variables during the upgrade process.
