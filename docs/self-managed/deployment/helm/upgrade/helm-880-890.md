Upgrade from Camunda 8.8 to Camunda 8.9 by upgrading the Helm chart version from 13.x to 14.x.

:::note Upgrade sequentially
Always upgrade from the latest patch of your current release to the latest patch of the next release.
Example: from 13.x.x → 14.0.1 (not 14.0.0).
:::

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before upgrading:

| Prerequisite                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helm chart version and Helm CLI version | Determine your Helm chart version and Helm CLI version and update them to the recommended versions listed in the [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).                                                                                                                                              |
| Configuration changes                   | Ensure all required configuration changes in this guide are reviewed, understood, and implemented before running the `helm upgrade` command.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8.8 `values.yaml`                       | The approach described in this guide uses your existing 8.8 `values.yaml` file as a basis to create a new 8.9 `values.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Secret management                       | The approach described in this guide is based on the assumption that all your secrets are referenced in an existing Kubernetes secret. See [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](../configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets) for further guidance. |
| Maintenance window                      | Plan a short downtime window for the upgrade. The former Operate, Tasklist, and Zeebe Gateway deployments are replaced by the new Orchestration Cluster, which becomes available once the `zeebe` StatefulSet rollout completes.                                                                                                          |

## Recommended upgrade steps

The recommended approach is as follows:

1. [Create 8.9 values.yaml](#step-1-create-89-valuesyaml): Copy your existing 8.8 `values.yaml` and use it as the basis for the new 8.8 file.
1. [Update for 8.9 compatibility](#step-2-update-for-89-compatibility): Adjust the new `values.yaml` to match the changes in 8.9 and its updated architecture.
1. [Prepare and run the upgrade](#step-3-prepare-and-run-the-upgrade): Add the required upgrade-specific configuration and steps, then execute the helm upgrade command.
1. [Monitor and validate](#step-4-monitor-and-validate): Track the upgrade process and ensure all components start and function properly.

:::caution
**During the upgrade, you must keep the same overall deployment setup.** Configuration values must be updated where required for 8.9 compatibility, but architectural changes or switching authentication methods are not supported during the upgrade. For example, the same components should remain deployed, the same database connections used, and your authentication method must stay the same.
:::

## Step 1: Create 8.9 `values.yaml`

Copy your existing 8.8 values.yaml, rename it (for example, `values-8.9.yaml`), and use it as the basis for your 8.9 configuration.

## Step 2: Update for 8.9 compatibility

Go through the following sections and configure your new 8.9 `values.yaml` file to be compatible with the new 8.9 changes and architecture.

:::info Key 8.9 changes
Review [What’s new in Camunda 8.8](#)  
and [Assess Camunda 8.8 changes and impact](#) before proceeding with your upgrade from 8.8.  
:::

### Values key changes

Adjust your `values.yaml` for the 8.9 configuration changes, and double-check for any deprecated or renamed values, we recommend the order as defined by the following keys:

| **13.x/8.8 values.yaml** | **14.x/8.9 values.yaml** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `TBD`                    |

### Other changes (TBD)

#### Elasticsearch is now disabled by default

If you are currently using elasticsearch, make sure to explicitly enable it in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
global:
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
```

## Step 3: Prepare and run the upgrade

Add required upgrade-specific configuration.

TDB

### Upgrade with Helm

After preparing your secrets and setting the migration configuratio, trigger the upgrade with `helm upgrade`:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform -f values-8.8.yaml
```

## Step 4: Monitor and validate

### Monitor the upgrade

After triggering the Helm upgrade, monitor the rollout to ensure all pods return to a healthy state and the migration jobs finish successfully.

#### 1. Watch pod rollout progress

Watch the pods being migrated via:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -w
```

**What you should see:**

- Pods gradually terminate and restart with new versions.

### Validate the upgrade

1. Confirm all pods are healhy:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
```

2. Confirm all pods are running on the new 8.9.x images:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{':\t'}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{'\n'}{end}{end}"
```

3. Verify access to Camunda components

- Acess Camunda components and verify users can log in with migrated roles. E.g. for the Orchestration cluster access:

```bash
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/operate
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/tasklist
https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/identity
```

4. Verify workers

If you’re running external workers for Camunda processes, ensure they are still connected and actively processing tasks after the migration.

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrade failed due to missing secrets

The following upgrade error might be related to not having secrets as Kubernetes referenced secrets as required in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (camunda-platform/charts/identity/templates/tasklist-secret.yaml:10:22):
PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                 Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.
                 Further information can be obtained at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases

    'global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret' must not be empty, please add '--set global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret=$TASKLIST_SECRET' to the command. To get the current value:

        export TASKLIST_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "camunda" "camunda-platform-test-tasklist-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.tasklist-secret}" | base64 --decode)
```

When the Helm chart is removed or upgraded, persistent volume claims (PVCs) for secret storage are not removed or recreated. To prevent Helm from recreating secrets that have already been generated, the [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common) library chart used by Camunda blocks the upgrade path, resulting in the above error.
