#### Create an S3 bucket for Terraform state management

Before setting up Terraform, you need to create an S3 bucket that will store the state file. This is important for collaboration and to prevent issues like state file corruption.

To start, set the region as an environment variable upfront to avoid repeating it in each command:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=<your-region>
```

Replace `<your-region>` with your chosen AWS region (for example, `eu-central-1`).

:::note Special case us-east-1

Regions outside of `us-east-1` require the appropriate `LocationConstraint` to be specified in order to create the bucket in the desired region.
While `us-east-1` does not require it and can only be created without specifying it.

:::

:::note Region of the bucket's state

This region can be different from the regions used for other resources, but it requires to be set explicitly in the backend configuration using the flag: `-backend-config="region=<your-region>"`.

For clarity, this guide explicitly sets the bucket region in all relevant commands.

Now, follow these steps to create the S3 bucket with versioning enabled:

1. Open your terminal and ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured.

2. Run the following command to create an S3 bucket for storing your Terraform state. Make sure to use a unique bucket name and set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable beforehand:

   ```bash reference
   https://github.com/camunda/camunda-deployment-references/blob/main/aws/common/procedure/s3-bucket/s3-bucket-creation.sh
   ```

3. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket to track changes and protect the state file from accidental deletions or overwrites:

   ```bash reference
   https://github.com/camunda/camunda-deployment-references/blob/main/aws/common/procedure/s3-bucket/s3-bucket-versioning.sh
   ```

4. Secure the bucket by blocking public access:

   ```bash reference
   https://github.com/camunda/camunda-deployment-references/blob/main/aws/common/procedure/s3-bucket/s3-bucket-private.sh
   ```

5. Verify versioning is enabled on the bucket:

   ```bash reference
   https://github.com/camunda/camunda-deployment-references/blob/main/aws/common/procedure/s3-bucket/s3-bucket-verify.sh
   ```

This S3 bucket will now securely store your Terraform state files with versioning enabled.
