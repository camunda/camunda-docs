:::info Single namespace deployment
This guide uses a single Kubernetes namespace for simplicity, since the deployment is done with a single Helm chart. This differs from the [reference architecture](/self-managed/reference-architecture/reference-architecture.md#components), which recommends separating Orchestration Cluster and Web Modeler or Console into different namespaces in production to improve isolation and enable independent scaling.
