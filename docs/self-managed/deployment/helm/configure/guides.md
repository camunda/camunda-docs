Camunda 8 Self-Managed is highly customizable and can be deployed in different setups. This section highlights various use cases and scenarios of configuring Camunda 8 beyond the default values.

Each guide is considered complete and a standalone use case. However, view the [deploying Camunda 8 using Helm charts](/self-managed/deployment/helm/install/quick-install.md) page, as this is the base for all guides.
