Instead of using internal Keycloak, you can configure Camunda to connect to an external IdP, such as an external Keycloak, Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta.

See [Helm chart OpenID Connect provider setup](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/authentication-and-authorization/connect-to-an-oidc-provider.md) for details.
