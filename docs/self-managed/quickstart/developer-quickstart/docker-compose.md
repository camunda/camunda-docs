import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import {DockerCompose} from "@site/src/components/CamundaDistributions";

A Docker Compose configuration to run Camunda Self-Managed components (Orchestration Cluster, Optimize, Console, and Connectors). Docker Compose also supports document storage and management with [document handling](/self-managed/concepts/document-handling/overview.md).

:::note
While the [Docker images](/self-managed/installation-methods/docker/docker.md) themselves are supported for production usage, the Docker Compose files are designed for developers to run a local environment and are not intended for production use. For production, we recommend [Kubernetes](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/install.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Compose:** Version 1.27.0 or higher (supports the [latest compose specification](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)).
- **Docker:** Version 20.10.16 or higher.
- **Keycloak:** (Local development only). Configure Keycloak to resolve to 127.0.0.1 on your local machine and set `KEYCLOAK_HOST=keycloak` in the `.env` file for token refresh and logout functionality.

## Run Camunda 8 with Docker Compose

To start a complete Camunda 8 Self-Managed environment locally:

1. Download the artifact for Camunda 8 <DockerCompose/>, then extract it.
2. Run the following command in the extracted directory:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

3. Wait for the environment to initialize. This may take several minutes. Monitor the logs, especially the Keycloak container log, to ensure the components have started.

### Configuration options

Running `docker compose up -d` starts all Camunda components. The [Camunda Distributions repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-distributions) also includes additional configuration files for lightweight development.

- **docker-compose.yaml:** Contains all Camunda 8 components for a full-stack deployment, including the Orchestration Cluster, Connectors, Optimize, Console, Elasticsearch, Keycloak, Web Modeler, and PostgreSQL.
- **docker-compose-core.yaml:** Contains only the Camunda 8 Orchestration Cluster components and Connectors.
- **docker-compose-web-modeler.yaml:** Contains the standalone Camunda 8 Web Modeler installation. For more information, see the [Web Modeler instructions](#web-modeler).

To start Camunda with an alternate configuration, specify the configuration file using the following command:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-core.yaml up -d
```

### Access components

You can log in to all web interfaces using with the default credentials:

- **Username:** `demo`
- **Password:** `demo`

#### Orchestration Cluster

- Operate: [http://localhost:8088/operate](http://localhost:8088/operate)
- Tasklist: [http://localhost:8088/tasklist](http://localhost:8088/tasklist)
- Identity: [http://localhost:8088/identity](http://localhost:8088/identity)
- Orchestration Cluster REST API: `http://localhost:8088/v2`
- Zeebe API (gRPC): `localhost:26500`

#### Management and Modeling components

- Console: [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087)
- Optimize: [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
- Management Identity: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)
- Web Modeler: [http://localhost:8070](http://localhost:8070)

#### External Dependencies

- Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)
  Elasticsearch is used by Orchestration Cluster (as secondary storage) and Optimize.
- Keycloak: [http://localhost:18080/auth/](http://localhost:18080/auth/)
  Keycloak is used to manage users for Management and Modeling components and can be accessed with the username `admin` and password `admin`. Users for the Orchestration Cluster are mangaed within the Orchestration Cluster itself.

### Stop Camunda 8

Run the following command to stop Camunda 8:

```shell
docker compose down -v
```

:::caution
This will also delete any data you created.
:::

To tear down the environment and keep any data, run the following command:

```shell
docker compose down
```

## Modeling and process execution

### Web Modeler

:::info
Non-production installations of Web Modeler are limited to five collaborators per project. Refer to the [licensing documentation](/reference/licenses.md) for more information.
:::

#### Standalone setup

Web Modeler is included by default when running the `docker-compose.yaml` configuration but can also be run independently with Identity, Keycloak, and Postgres as dependencies.

The following command uses the provided `docker-compose-web-modeler.yaml` configuration file to start only Web Modeler and its dependencies:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-web-modeler.yaml up -d
```

To tear down the environment (including all data and volumes), run the following command:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-web-modeler.yaml down -v
```

#### Deploy or execute a process

The local orchestration cluster started using the provided `docker-compose.yaml` is pre-configured in Web Modeler.

#### Emails

The provided configuration includes [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) as a test SMTP server. It captures all emails sent by Web Modeler but does not forward them to the actual recipients.

You can access emails in Mailpitâ€™s web UI at [http://localhost:8075](http://localhost:8075).

### Use the Orchestration Cluster REST API

- (If authentication is enabled) [Authenticate](apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-authentication.md)
- [Deploy resources](apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/specifications/create-deployment.api.mdx)
- [Create a process instance](apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/specifications/create-process-instance.api.mdx)

### Desktop Modeler

:::info
Desktop Modeler is [open source and free to use](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler).
:::

[Download the Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) to start modeling BPMN, DMN, and Camunda Forms on your local machine.

## Secure the Orchestration Cluster REST API

By default, the Orchestration Cluster REST API is publicly accessible without requiring any client credentials for development purposes.

## Connectors

Both the full and lightweight Docker Compose files include a configuration for [out-of-the-box connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md). Refer to the [Connector installation guide](/self-managed/components/connectors/overview.md) for details on how to provide related connector templates for modeling.

### Connector secrets

Secrets can be added into the connector runtime using the included `connector-secrets.txt` file. Add secrets in the format `NAME=VALUE`, one per line. The secrets will then be available in the connector runtime as `secrets.NAME`.

### Custom connectors

To add custom connectors, create a new Docker image bundling them as described in the [Connectors repository](https://github.com/camunda/connectors).

Alternatively, you can mount new connector JARs as volumes into the `/opt/app` folder by adding this to the Docker Compose file. Keep in mind that connector JARs must include all necessary dependencies inside the JAR.

## Next steps

Check out the [getting started guide](/guides/getting-started-example.md) to start a new Java Project to connect to this local cluster.
