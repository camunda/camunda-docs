:::note
Camunda 8 Run is not supported for production use.
:::

Camunda 8 Run enables you to run [Orchestration cluster](../../../../reference/glossary#orchestration-cluster), including Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, Identity, and Elasticsearch, with minimal configuration. It is intended for developers who want to model BPMN diagrams, deploy them, and interact with running process instances in a simple environment. This guide explains how to get started on your local or virtual machine.

Camunda 8 Run includes the following:

- Orchestration Cluster
- Connectors
- Elasticsearch

Camunda 8 Run also supports document storage and management with [document handling](/self-managed/concepts/document-handling/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- **OpenJDK 21–23**: Required for running Camunda 8 as a Java application.
- **Docker 20.10.21+**: Required for running Camunda 8 via Docker Compose.
- **[Desktop Modeler](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md)**
- **If using Ubuntu**: Ubuntu 22.04 or newer

:::note
After installing OpenJDK, ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set by running `java -version` in a **new** terminal.

If no version of Java is found, follow your chosen installation's instructions for setting `JAVA_HOME` before continuing.
:::

## Install and start Camunda 8 Run

1. Download the latest release of <C8Run/> for your operating system and architecture. Opening the `.tgz` file extracts the Camunda 8 Run script into a new directory.
2. Navigate to the new `c8run` directory.
3. Start Camunda 8 Run by running one of the following in your terminal:

- On Mac and Linux:
  - Run the helper script: `./start.sh`
  - Or use the CLI command: `./c8run start`
- On Windows:
  - Use the CLI command: `.\c8run.exe start`

If startup is successful, a browser window for Operate will open automatically. Alternatively, you can access Operate at [http://localhost:8080/operate](http://localhost:8080/operate).

To start Camunda 8 in Docker Compose using C8Run you can use the following option. It is equivalent of running `docker compose up -d` :

- On Mac and Linux: `./start.sh --docker`
- On Windows: `.\c8run.exe start --docker`

When started with Docker, Operate will be available at [http://localhost:8088/operate](http://localhost:8088/operate).

:::note
If Camunda 8 Run fails to start, run the [shutdown script](#shut-down-camunda-8-run) to end the current processes, then run the start script again.

### Configuration options

The following options provide a convenient way to override settings for quick tests and interactions in Camunda 8 Run.  
For more advanced or permanent configuration, modify the default `configuration/application.yaml` or supply a custom file using the `--config` flag (e.g., [to enable authentication and authorization](#enable-authentication-and-authorization)).

| Argument                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Work with Camunda 8 Run

### Access Camunda components

Camunda 8 Run uses basic authentication with demo/demo for all web interfaces. OIDC/Keycloak is not included in this distribution.
You can log in to all web interfaces using with the default credentials:

- **Username:** `demo`
- **Password:** `demo`

These web interfaces are available at:

- **Operate:** http://localhost:8080/operate
- **Tasklist:** http://localhost:8080/tasklist
- **Identity:** http://localhost:8080/identity

The following components do not have a web interface, but their endpoints are useful for additional configuration:

- **Orchestration Cluster REST API:** http://localhost:8080/v2/
- **Inbound Connectors API:** http://localhost:8086/
- **Zeebe API (gRPC):** http://localhost:26500/
- **Metrics (Prometheus):** http://localhost:9600/actuator/prometheus
- **Swagger UI (API Explorer):** http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

:::note

- The URLs for the Docker Compose application can be found in the [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) documentation.
- The Connectors API does not provide a web interface. If you access its URL in a browser, you may see a login page, but it cannot be used to sign in. Use the API endpoints directly instead.
  :::

### Deploy diagrams from Desktop Modeler

Make sure you have installed [Desktop Modeler](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler.md) before continuing.

To [deploy diagrams](/self-managed/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/deploy-to-self-managed.md) from Desktop Modeler, use the following configuration:

- **Target:** Self-Managed
- **Cluster endpoint:** `http://localhost:26500` (Zeebe Gateway)
- **Authentication:** None

A success notification will display when complete. [Start a new process instance](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/start-instance.md) to view your running process in Operate.

### Use built-in and custom connectors

Desktop Modeler [automatically fetches](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/use-connectors.md#automatic-connector-template-fetching) templates for pre-built connectors. [Custom connectors](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md) can also be added to your Camunda 8 Run distribution.

To add a custom connector:

1. Place the connector’s `.jar` file in the `/custom_connectors` folder within the `/c8run` directory.
2. Place the element template in the appropriate folder for your installation. See [Search Paths](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/search-paths/search-paths.md) for more information.

Once configured, your connectors are available for use in Modeler.

### Configure Connector secrets

Connector Secrets can be provided as environment variables by adding them to the `.env` file in the root folder.

When starting C8Run with the `--docker` option, add the connector secrets to the `connector-secrets.txt` file in the docker-compose folder.

### Use Camunda APIs

All APIs **do not require authentication by default** in Camunda 8 Run and can be accessed without credentials or tokens.

Available APIs include:

- [Orchestration Cluster REST API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/orchestration-cluster-api-rest-overview.md)
- [Zeebe gRPC](/apis-tools/zeebe-api/grpc.md)

### Enable authentication and authorization

By default, Camunda 8 Run configures authentication for web interfaces (demo/demo) but all API endpoints are open and do not require authentication. To secure APIs, enable authorization in application.yaml.

You can either:

- Update the existing `configuration/application.yaml`, or
- Create a new `application.yaml` in the `/c8run` folder and pass it at startup using the [`--config` flag](#configuration-options):

```yaml
camunda:
  security:
    authentication:
      # Require authentication for API requests
      unprotected-api: false
    authorizations:
      # Enable authorization checks
      enabled: true
```

Start C8Run with the configuration:

```bash
./start.sh --config application.yaml
```

Once enabled, API requests must include valid credentials. For example:

```shell
curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/v2/topology'  \
  -u demo:demo \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{}'
```

To add additional users (e.g., an admin user), extend the configuration:

```yaml
camunda:
  security:
    initialization:
      users:
        - username: user
          password: user
          name: user
          email: user@example.com
      defaultRoles:
        admin:
          users:
            - user
```

## Shut down Camunda 8 Run

To shut down (non-Docker) Camunda 8 Run and end all running processes, run the following command from the `c8run` directory:

```bash
./shutdown.sh

# Windows:
# .\c8run.exe stop
```

If you started Camunda 8 Run with Docker `./start.sh --docker`, run the following command instead:

```bash
# Stop containers but keep existing data
docker compose -f docker-compose-8.8/docker-compose.yaml down
# (older bundles use: docker/docker-compose.yml)

# Stop containers and remove all data volumes
docker compose -f docker-compose-8.8/docker-compose.yaml down -v
```

The `-v` option removes all Docker volumes, including persisted data such as users and process instances. Omit `-v` if you want to keep your existing data for the next startup.

To confirm that Camunda 8 Run has stopped, check for active containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Advanced options

### Enable TLS

TLS can be enabled by providing a local keystore file using the `--keystore` argument at startup. Camunda 8 Run accepts `.jks` certificate files.
Although C8Run supports TLS, this is intended only for testing.

### Access metrics

Metrics are enabled in Camunda 8 Run by default and can be accessed at [http://localhost:9600/actuator/prometheus](http://localhost:9600/actuator/prometheus). For more information, see the [metrics](/self-managed/operational-guides/monitoring/metrics.md) documentation.

### Start external Elasticsearch

By default, Camunda 8 Run starts with an embedded Elasticsearch.
To use an external instance, run Camunda 8 Run without its built-in Elasticsearch and connect it to your own instance.

1. Start a single-node Elasticsearch container with security disabled:

   ```bash
   docker run \
       -m 1GB \
       -d \
       --name elasticsearch \
       -p 9200:9200 \
       -p 9300:9300 \
       -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
       -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
       elasticsearch:8.15.2
   ```

1. Configure Camunda 8 Run by creating an `application.yaml` file that points to your external Elasticsearch:

   ```yaml
   camunda:
     data:
       secondary-storage:
         elasticsearch:
           url: "http://127.0.0.1:9200/"
   ```

1. Start Camunda 8 Run with the `--disable-elasticsearch` flag to prevent it from starting its own instance, and provide your config:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh --disable-elasticsearch --config application.yaml
   ```

### Environment variables

The following advanced configuration options can be provided via environment variables:

| Variable       | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ES_JAVA_OPTS` | Allows you to override Java command line parameters for Elasticsearch. This can allow you to increase memory limits. **Default:** `-Xms1g -Xmx1g` |
| `JAVA_OPTS`    | Allows you to override Java command line parameters for Camunda.                                                                                  |
