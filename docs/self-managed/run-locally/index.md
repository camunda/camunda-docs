This section helps you run Camunda 8 Self-Managed locally for development, testing, or evaluation purposes. While these setups are not intended for production, they are ideal to explore Camunda 8, develop, build and test workflows, prototype, or verify configurations before moving to production. For a hands-on developer experience, check out the [Java Getting Started Guide](../../guides/getting-started-java-spring.md) to quickly create and run your first process application.
