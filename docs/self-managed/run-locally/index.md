This section helps you run Camunda 8 Self-Managed locally for development, testing, or evaluation purposes. These options are not intended for production use, but theyâ€™re ideal for exploring the platform, building prototypes, or verifying configurations before deploying to a production environment.

You can choose from different local deployment methods such as C8Run, Docker Compose or Helm with a local Kubernetes cluster.

:::info
For production-grade deployments, including configuration, scaling, and security best practices, see [**Production Installations**](../setup/overview.md).
