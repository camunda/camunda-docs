:::caution
IAM has been replaced with Identity for version 1.4+. Please refer to the
[Identity documentation](../identity/what-is-identity.md) for ongoing support.

IAM is the component within the Camunda Cloud stack responsible for authentication and authorization. It allows you to:

- Manage users
- Manage roles
- Manage permissions

### That's great, but what do I do now?

If you're new to IAM, we suggest reviewing [Step 1: Setup environment](../getting-started/docker/setup-environment/) to get started on your journey!
