In this guide we will show you how to use Identity to create authorizations for a group.

:::caution Write access needed
To create an authorization for a group, you need to have write access to Identity.
Read our [guide on managing user access](../managing-user-access.md) to learn more.
:::

1. Log in to the Identity UI and navigate to the **Groups** tab, select the group you would like to create an authorization for from the table, and click on the **Authorizations** tab:
