Identity is the component within the Camunda 8 stack responsible for authentication and authorization. It allows you to manage:

- [Applications](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/applications.md)
- [APIs](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/apis.md)
- [Permissions](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/resource-authorizations.md)
- [Roles](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/resource-authorizations.md)
