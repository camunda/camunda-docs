:::note Heads Up!
To update Optimize to version 3.3.0 please perform the following steps first: [Migration & Update Instructions](./instructions.md).

Here you will find information about:

* limitations, 
* known issues, 
* changes in the supported environments, 
* any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

# Known issues

## Error during migration of Dashboards when Updating from Optimize 3.2.0 to 3.3.0

During the update from Optimize 3.2.0 to 3.3.0 you may encounter the following error:

```
Starting step 6/7: UpdateIndexStep on index: dashboard
Progress of task (id:FwvhN1jsRUe1JQD49-C3Qg:12009) on index optimize-dashboard_v4: 0% (total: 1, updated: 0, created: 0, deleted: 0)
An Elasticsearch task that is part of the update failed: Error{type='script_exception', reason='runtime error', phase='null'}

```

This can happen if you started using an Optimize version prior to 3.1.0 in your environment in the past and did not manually edit/update at least one particular dashboard created with such a version since then.

To recover from this situation you can run the following update script on all Optimize dashboards on your elasticsearch cluster:
```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:9200/optimize-dashboard_v3/_update_by_query' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "script": {
        "source": "if (ctx._source.availableFilters == null) { ctx._source.availableFilters = [] }",
        "lang": "painless"
    }
}'
```
and then resume the update to Optimize 3.3.0 by just rerunning it, thanks to Optimize updates being [resumable](https://camunda.com/blog/2021/01/camunda-optimize-3-3-0-released/#Resumable-Updates) since Optimize 3.3.0.

# Breaking Changes
## Renamed environment folder to config 

The `environment` folder, which holds all configuration files has been renamed to `config`.

## Elasticsearch

Optimize no longer supports Elasticsearch versions 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2.
See the [Supported Environments](./../../../reference/supported-environments.md/#elasticsearch) sections for the full range of supported versions.

## Docker Image Environment Variables

Previously it was possible to use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable on the official Optimize Docker Image to configure the JVM that runs Optimize. With Optimize 3.3.0 this variable got renamed to `OPTIMIZE_JAVA_OPTS`.
