:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.7.x, perform the following steps: [Migration & Update Instructions](./instructions.md).
:::
REVERT
The update to 3.7.x can be performed from any 3.6.x release.

Here you will find information about:

* Limitations
* Known issues
* Changes in the supported environments
* Any unexpected behavior of Optimize (e.g due to a new feature)

## Known issues

The Optimize 3.7.0 release contains a number of bugs related to dashboard templates, alerts, and the report builder. We thus recommend updating to 3.7.1 if you are already using 3.7.0, or directly updating to 3.7.1 if you are still running a 3.6.x release.

For details on the issues, refer to the [Optimize 3.7.1 Release Notes](https://jira.camunda.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10730&version=17434).

## New behavior

### Added support for object and list variables

With Optimize 3.7, we've added support for object and list variables. Variables with type `Object` are now automatically imported and flattened into dedicated "sub variables" for each object property. If you have previously used a variable import plugin to achieve the same, you may disable this plugin after migrating to Optimize 3.7.

Find more information about importing object variables [here](../../setup/object-variables).
