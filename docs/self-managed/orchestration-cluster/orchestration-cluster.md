Install and configure Orchestration Cluster components in your Self-Managed environment.

## Installation and configuration

The Orchestration Cluster is the core component of Camunda 8, powering the automation and orchestration of processes. An Orchestration Cluster includes:

- Zeebe as the workflow engine
- Operate for monitoring and troubleshooting process instances running in Zeebe.
- Tasklist for interacting with user tasks (assigning, completing, and so on).
- Identity for managing the integrated authentication and authorization.
- APIs for interacting with the Orchestration Cluster programmatically.

In this section, you will learn how to install, and configure these components in your Self-Managed environment.
