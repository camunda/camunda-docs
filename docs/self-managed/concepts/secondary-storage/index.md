Camunda uses a layered storage model that separates workflow execution data from data used by web applications and APIs.

## About secondary storage

Secondary storage is one of the two complementary layers in Camunda’s data model:

| Layer             | Purpose                                                                                                                           | Typical technologies                                      |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary storage   | Persists real-time workflow execution state managed by [Zeebe](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/overview.md). | RocksDB (embedded in Zeebe)                               |
| Secondary storage | Stores workflow, decision, and task data for querying, visualization, and API access.                                             | Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, RDBMS (H2, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) |

:::note
Secondary storage is not a duplicate of primary data. It represents the historical workflow and decision data generated by the engine, optimized for querying and visualization.

### Supported storage options

Camunda supports multiple secondary storage backends.  
For the latest list of supported database versions, see the  
[RDBMS version support policy](/self-managed/concepts/databases/relational-db/rdbms-support-policy.md).

| Database type            | Availability         | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elasticsearch/OpenSearch | General availability | Default for most production installations.                                                                                                                                                      |
| RDBMS                    | 8.9-alpha1+          | Supports relational databases for secondary storage. See the [RDBMS support policy](/self-managed/concepts/databases/relational-db/rdbms-support-policy.md) for supported vendors and versions. |

:::info OpenSearch support
Camunda 8 supports both [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service) and the open-source [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) distribution.

### Data flow

The following diagram shows how secondary storage fits into the Camunda data flow.

<img src={DataFlowImg} alt="Camunda data flow showing secondary storage" class="img-noborder img-transparent"/>

1. The Zeebe broker executes workflow instances and stores state in primary storage.
1. The exporter, part of Zeebe, streams workflow and task data to secondary storage.
1. Applications such as Operate, Tasklist, and the REST API read data from secondary storage.

## Configure secondary storage

Learn how to configure secondary storage in Self-Managed environments using Helm, Docker, or manual deployment.

<p><a href="./configuring-secondary-storage" class="link-arrow">Configure secondary storage</a></p>

:::note
Although you should use secondary storage in nearly all your production environments, you can choose to disable secondary storage in limited scenarios, such as lightweight development environments, specialized technical use cases, or resource-constrained deployments. See [run without secondary storage](no-secondary-storage.md).

## Manage secondary storage

Learn about best practices for data management, backups, and monitoring to ensure data integrity and performance.

Effective secondary storage management ensures stability, scalability, and data integrity across your Camunda environment. By following Camunda best practices, you can avoid data corruption, maintain compliance, and ensure your orchestration environment remains performant and reliable.
