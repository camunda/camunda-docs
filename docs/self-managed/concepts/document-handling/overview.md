import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Store, track, and manage documents in Camunda 8 using the [Camunda 8 API](/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/specifications/create-documents.api.mdx), Connectors, Forms, and Tasklist.

Offering robust document handling capabilities within Camunda Self-Managed, users can efficiently manage large volumes of binary data such as PDFs and images across both development and production environments.

## Use cases and capabilities

Document handling can be beneficial for different process use cases, such as uploading a document to a BPMN process, displaying and downloading a document, sending a document to an external system via a Connector, and automating documents with [intelligent document processing](/components/modeler/web-modeler/idp/idp-example.md).

Step through all of these capabilities in the guide below:
