Console makes it easier to access usage metrics from Operate and Tasklist. The corresponding page allows you to select the time period and the clusters and displays the consumption data. The same endpoints are queried as described [here](../operate-deployment/usage-metrics.md) and [here](../tasklist-deployment/usage-metrics.md).

:::note
If you are not running Tasklist or Operate, there is currently no way to retrieve usage metrics until future releases.
