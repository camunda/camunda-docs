This page is a work in progress for Camunda 8.9 and will be updated as upgrade requirements are finalized.
:::

Upgrade a Helm-managed Camunda 8 Self-Managed deployment from version 8.8 to 8.9.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading:

- Confirm your deployment is running the latest `8.8.x` patch. If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.8, see [Upgrading from an earlier version](/self-managed/upgrade/index.md#upgrading-from-an-earlier-version).
- Review [Prepare for upgrade](/self-managed/upgrade/prepare-for-upgrade.md) to confirm upgrade eligibility and complete any required pre-upgrade actions for 8.9.
- Review the Camunda Helm chart [version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/) and confirm:
  - the Helm chart version that deploys Camunda 8.9 is supported for your Kubernetes version, and
  - your Helm client version is supported for that chart.
- Create and verify backups for your Camunda data. See [Backup and restore](../../../self-managed/operational-guides/backup-restore/backup-and-restore.md).
- Review your existing `values.yaml` for custom configuration that must be updated for 8.9 (for example, Ingress rules, authentication, exporters, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch settings, index prefixes, and component overrides).
- Test the upgrade in a non-production environment using a copy of your production configuration.
- If your `values.yaml` contains plaintext secrets, migrate them to Kubernetes secrets before upgrading. See [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes secrets](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets).

<!--
TODO (8.9):
If the 8.8 -> 8.9 upgrade introduces additional prerequisite actions (for example, required migrations, consolidation steps, or incompatible client versions),
add them here as action-oriented bullets with links to the relevant 8.9 docs.
-->

## Create your 8.9 values file

Use your existing 8.8 configuration as the starting point for the upgrade.

1. Copy your current `values.yaml` and name the file `values-8.9.yaml`.

1. Download the default values for the Camunda 8.9 Helm chart:

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   helm show values camunda/camunda-platform --version <CHART_VERSION> > values-8.9-default.yaml
   ```

   To identify the latest available chart version, run:

   ```bash
   helm search repo camunda/camunda-platform --versions
   ```

1. Compare `values-8.9.yaml` with `values-8.9-default.yaml` to identify:
   - new configuration options,
   - changed defaults, and
   - deprecated or removed settings.

1. Update `values-8.9.yaml` using the configuration tables below before running `helm upgrade`.

## Update your values file to 8.9

Use the following sections to update `values-8.9.yaml` for the 8.8 to 8.9 upgrade.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- If 8.9 introduces key moves/renames, add mapping tables similar to 8.8.
- If no mapping tables are needed for 8.9, remove this section and focus on the "Prepare and run the upgrade" section below.
-->

### Configuration changes

<!--
TODO (8.9):
Add rows for confirmed configuration key changes between 8.8 and 8.9.
Keep entries action-oriented (move, rename, remove, update value type).
-->

| **13.x/8.8 values** | **14.x/8.9 values** |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `TBD`               |                     |
|                     |                     |

#### Elasticsearch is now disabled by default

If you are currently using elasticsearch, you must explicitly enable it in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
global:
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
```

## Example: upgrade `values.yaml` from 8.8 to 8.9

This section shows a complete before-and-after example of a Helm `values.yaml` migrated from Camunda 8.8 to 8.9.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Replace with a complete 8.8 -> 8.9 example once configuration changes are confirmed.
- Remove this section if the 8.9 upgrade does not require a meaningful before/after example.

<TabItem value="before" label="8.8 values.yaml (before)">

```yaml
# =========================
# Camunda 8.8 values.yaml

# TODO (8.9): Add a representative 8.8 configuration example.
```

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</details>

## Prepare and run the upgrade

Add any upgrade-specific configuration required for the 8.9 upgrade.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
Add sections here for any required migrations or one-time upgrade configuration.
Keep these sections action-oriented and link out to detailed component guidance where needed.
-->

## Run the Helm upgrade

After preparing secrets and applying any required 8.9 configuration changes, run the Helm upgrade:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade camunda camunda/camunda-platform \
  --namespace <NAMESPACE> \
  -f values-8.9.yaml
```

## Monitor and validate the upgrade

After triggering the Helm upgrade, monitor the rollout to ensure all pods return to a healthy state and any migration jobs complete.

### Watch pod rollout progress

Watch the pods being upgraded via:

```bash
kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> get pods -w
```

You should see pods terminating and restarting with updated images.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
If the 8.9 upgrade runs migration jobs, document:
- expected job names and what they do
- what "success" looks like (status, log line, etc.)
-->

### Inspect logs (if required)

```bash
# TODO (8.9): Add log commands for any 8.9-specific jobs or components that require verification.
```

### Validate the upgrade

1. Confirm all pods are healthy:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
   ```

1. Confirm all pods are running `8.9.x` images:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{':\t'}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{'\n'}{end}{end}"
   ```

1. Verify access to Camunda components.

   For example:

   ```bash
   https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/operate
   https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/tasklist
   https://<your-domain>/<contextPath>/identity
   ```

1. Verify authentication and authorization behavior, based on your configuration.

1. Verify workers.

   Confirm your workers can still poll and complete jobs (for example, by running a known process end-to-end and checking worker logs/metrics).

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrade failed due to missing secrets

If your upgrade fails due to missing credentials (often when migrating from chart-managed secret generation to Kubernetes secrets), see [Extract plaintext values and reference them as Kubernetes Secrets](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets).

The [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common) library chart used by Camunda can block upgrades when credentials were previously generated and persisted (for example, in PVCs). This is expected behavior to prevent secret regeneration.

For additional context, see <HelmChartValuesFileBitnamiLegacyLink />.

The following is an example of the error you might see:

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (camunda-platform/charts/identity/templates/tasklist-secret.yaml:10:22):
PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                 Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.
                 Further information can be obtained at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases

    'global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret' must not be empty, please add '--set global.identity.auth.tasklist.existingSecret=$TASKLIST_SECRET' to the command. To get the current value:

        export TASKLIST_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "camunda" "camunda-platform-test-tasklist-identity-secret" -o jsonpath="{.data.tasklist-secret}" | base64 --decode)
```

To complete the upgrade, migrate plaintext values to Kubernetes secrets and reference them from your values file as described in the [secret management guide](/self-managed/deployment/helm/configure/secret-management.md#extract-plaintext-values-and-reference-them-as-kubernetes-secrets).
