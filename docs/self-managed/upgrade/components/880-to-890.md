:::note
This page is a work in progress for Camunda 8.9 and will be updated as upgrade requirements are finalized.
:::

Review component-level actions that may be required when upgrading a Camunda 8 Self-Managed deployment from 8.8.x to 8.9.x.

Use this page together with the deployment upgrade guide for your environment. Start with the [Upgrade Camunda 8 overview](/self-managed/upgrade/index.md), then apply any component-specific steps that match your setup.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Keep sections action-oriented: "what you must do" and "when it applies".
- Remove any section that has no confirmed 8.8 → 8.9 actions before publishing.
- If a section applies only to specific deployment methods, cross-link to the Helm/manual upgrade guides instead of duplicating.
-->

## Verify secondary storage compatibility

If your deployment uses Elasticsearch or OpenSearch as secondary storage, verify your cluster meets the supported versions for 8.9 and that your configuration remains compatible.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add only the confirmed 8.9 requirements (versions, topology constraints, index settings changes).
- If there is no change from 8.8, remove this section before publish.
-->

## Review custom index prefixes and naming

If your deployment uses non-default index prefixes or custom naming conventions, confirm whether any updates are required for 8.9.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add actions only if 8.9 introduces new naming/schema requirements.
- If no prefix-related changes exist in 8.9, remove this section before publish.
-->

## Identity and access management actions

If your deployment uses identity features (users, roles, groups, tenants, authorizations, mapping rules), review whether 8.9 requires any migration or configuration updates.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add only confirmed changes that require action (for example: authorization model changes, configuration keys, migration jobs).
- Do not restate release notes. Provide concrete "do X, then verify Y" steps.
- If no IAM actions exist for 8.9, remove this section before publish.
-->

## Data migration actions

Some upgrades require running a migration tool or enabling migration as part of your deployment upgrade flow.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add the list of 8.9 migrations only if they exist and require manual action.
- If migrations are Helm-only or method-specific, link to the relevant guide section instead of duplicating instructions.
- Include what to verify (success criteria: logs/metrics/index checks) rather than long background text.
-->

## API behavior and client impact

If you use Camunda APIs directly (or generate clients from OpenAPI), review whether 8.9 introduces changes that require updates before or after upgrading.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Document only breaking or required client changes for 8.9.
- Keep this section short: "If you use X, update Y before upgrade" + link to migration notes.
- If no required changes exist, remove this section before publish.
-->

## Exported records and exporter configuration

If you rely on exported records for downstream systems (analytics, monitoring, custom consumers), verify whether any exporter configuration or exported record behavior changes in 8.9 affect you.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add actions only if defaults or supported record types change in 8.9.
- Include explicit verification steps (sample check: exporter enabled, records present, consumer healthy).
- If unchanged, remove before publish.
-->

## Connectors

If you use Connectors, review whether any connector behavior changes in 8.9 require action (configuration updates, payload expectations, compatibility notes).

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add only connector changes that require action.
- If the change is connector-specific, link to connector docs instead of adding long detail here.
-->

## Logging

If you use custom logging configuration, verify whether 8.9 changes any defaults or requires updates to your logging setup.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add only actionable changes (env var names, defaults, config file paths, formats).
- If unchanged, remove before publish.
-->

## Web Modeler

If you run Web Modeler (especially with cluster configuration), verify whether 8.9 introduces any required configuration updates.

<!--
TODO (8.9):
- Add only confirmed 8.9 actions (auth method changes, required env vars, renamed keys).
- Prefer linking to the Web Modeler configuration docs for full detail.
