Console makes it easier to access usage metrics from Operate and Tasklist. The corresponding page allows you to select the time period and the clusters, and displays the subsequent consumption data. The same endpoints are queried as described [in the usage metrics documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/concepts/usage-metrics.md).

:::note
To retrieve usage metrics, you currently must be running Tasklist or Operate.
