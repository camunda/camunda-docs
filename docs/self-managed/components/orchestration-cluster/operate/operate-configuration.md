title: Configuration
---

As a Spring Boot application, Operate supports any standard
[Spring configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html) method.

By default, the configuration for Operate is stored in a YAML file (`application.yml`). All Operate-related settings are prefixed with `camunda.operate`.

:::note
Configuration properties can be defined as environment variables using [Spring Boot conventions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables). To define an environment variable, convert the configuration property to uppercase, remove any dashes, and replace any delimiters (`.`) with `_`.

For example, the property `camunda.operate.elasticsearch.clustername` is represented by the environment variable `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTERNAME`.
:::

The following parts are configurable:

## Licensing

See the [core settings documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/licensing.md).

## Webserver and security

See the [core settings documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/webserver.md).

## Elasticsearch or OpenSearch

See the [secondary storage documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/properties.md#secondary-storage) and [core settings documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/concepts/elasticsearch-and-opensearch.md).

## Zeebe Elasticsearch or OpenSearch exporter

:::note
**Version 8.8+:** The Importer is required only for **migration scenarios** (upgrades from 8.7). Keep it enabled until all remaining 8.7 records have been imported. After that, the [Camunda Exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/camunda-exporter.md) takes over and writes directly to the Operate indices. The Importer can then be safely disabled for subsequent restarts or deployments.

New 8.8+ installations do **not** need to enable or configure the Importer. Its only purpose is to temporarily support migrations from 8.7 data.
:::

For Elasticsearch, Operate imports data from indices created and filled in by the [Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter](../zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md).

For OpenSearch, Operate imports data from indices created and filled in by the [Zeebe OpenSearch exporter](../zeebe/exporters/opensearch-exporter.md).

Therefore, settings for this Elasticsearch or OpenSearch connection must be defined and must correspond to the settings on the Zeebe side.

### Settings to connect and import

See also [settings to connect to a secured Elasticsearch instance](#settings-to-connect-to-a-secured-elasticsearch-instance) or [settings to connect to a secured OpenSearch instance](#settings-to-connect-to-a-secured-opensearch-instance).

:::note
You may need to import the certificate keystore into the JVM runtime.

```yaml
# Kubernetes example:
zeebe:
  …
  javaOpts: >-
    …
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/certificates/elasticsearch.jks
```

## Operation executor

Operations are user operations, like cancellation of process instance(s) or updating the variable value.

Operations are executed in a multi-threaded manner.

| Name                                           | Description                      | Default value |

| camunda.operate.operationExecutor.threadsCount | How many threads should be used. | 3             |

### Snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  operationExecutor:
  	threadsCount: 3
```
