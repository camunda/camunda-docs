import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Tasklist provides two ways to authenticate:

1. User information stored in [Elasticsearch](#user-in-elasticsearch)
2. [Identity Authentication and Authorization](#identity)

By default, user storage in Elasticsearch is enabled.

<Tabs groupId="authentication" defaultValue="elasticsearch" queryString values={[{label: 'Elasticsearch', value: 'elasticsearch' },{label: 'Identity', value: 'identity' }]} >

<TabItem value="elasticsearch">

:::note
User restrictions are not supported when using Elasticsearch for user storage. If you want to use user restrictions, [Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md) is required.
:::

In this mode, the user authenticates with a username and password stored in Elasticsearch.

The **userId**, **password**, and **roles** for one user may be set in application.yml:

```
camunda.tasklist:
  userId: aUser
  password: aPassword
  displayName: aDisplayName
  roles:
    - OWNER
    - OPERATOR
```

On Tasklist startup, the user is created if they did not exist before.

By default, three users are created:

- Role `OWNER` with **userId**/**displayName**/**password** `demo`/`demo`/`demo`. To change userId, password, displayName or role for user `demo` use the above configuration.

- Role `USER` with **userId**/**displayName**/**password** `view`/`view`/`view`. To change userId, displayName or password for this user the below configuration can be used:

```
camunda.tasklist:
  readerUserId: aUser
  readerPassword: aPassword
  readerDisplayName: aDisplayName
```

- Role `OPERATOR` with **userId**/**displayName**/**password** `act`/`act`/`act`/. To change userId, displayName or password for this user the below configuration can be used:

```
camunda.tasklist:
  operatorUserId: aUser
  operatorPassword: aPassword
  operatorDisplayName: aDisplayName
```

More users can be added directly to Elasticsearch, to the index `tasklist-user-<version>_`. The password must be encoded with a strong BCrypt hashing function.

<TabItem value="identity">

[Identity](/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity.md) provides authentication and authorization functionality along with user management.

## Enable Identity

Identity can only be enabled by setting the [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `identity-auth`.

See the following example:

```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=identity-auth
```

## Configure Identity

Identity requires the following parameters:

## Resource-based permissions

1. Resource authorizations must be [enabled in Identity](/self-managed/identity/access-management/resource-authorizations.md).
2. Tasklist must be configured to use resource authorizations (see above configurations) and `camunda.tasklist.identity.resourcePermissionsEnabled` must be enabled.

Resource-based permissions are defined per process definition. Process definition is defined by **Process ID**, which is present in BPMN XML.

The user or user group can be assigned the following permission:

| Permission name        | Resource type(s)   | Allowed action(s) in Operate                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| START_PROCESS_INSTANCE | process-definition | User can start this process ad hoc on Tasklist. |

For more information, visit the [Identity documentation](/self-managed/identity/access-management/resource-authorizations.md).

## Use Identity JWT token to access Tasklist API

Tasklist provides a [REST API](/apis-tools/tasklist-api-rest/tasklist-api-rest-overview.md) under the endpoint `/v1`. Clients can access this API using a JWT access token in an authorization header `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.

:::note
Be aware a JWT token is intended to be used for M2M communication and is therefore issued for the relevant application, not for the user.
:::

**Example:**

1. [Add an application in Identity](/self-managed/identity/application-user-group-role-management/applications.md).
2. [Add permissions to an application](/self-managed/identity/application-user-group-role-management/applications.md) for Tasklist API.
3. Obtain a token to access the Tasklist REST API.
   You will need:
   - `client_id` and `client_secret` from Identity application you created.
   - URL of the authorization server will look like: `http://<keycloak_host>:<port>/auth/realms/camunda-platform/protocol/openid-connect/token`, where host and port reference Keycloak URL (e.g. `localhost:18080`).

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:18080/auth/realms/camunda-platform/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=<client id>' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<secret>' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```

You will get something like the following:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbG...",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "refresh_expires_in": 0,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "not-before-policy": 0
}
```

Take the `access_token` value from the response object and store it as your token.

4. Send the token as an authorization header in each request. In this case, request all tasks.

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/v1/tasks/search
```

## User task access restrictions

User task access restrictions are enabled by default. To disable, set the [`userAccessRestrictionsEnabled` Tasklist environment variable](/self-managed/components/tasklist/tasklist-authentication.md?authentication=identity#configure-identity) to `false`. When enabled, Tasklist applies additional security measures to only show tasks based on the logged-in users identity. The tasks displayed are restricted based on the candidate groups, candidate users, and assignee associated with the logged-in user. The benefits of this resource are:

- Enhanced security: Users only see tasks for which they have the necessary permissions, improving security and preventing unauthorized access.
- Tasklist customization: The Tasklist interface is tailored to display only relevant tasks for each user, providing a personalized and streamlined experience.

### Candidate groups

- Tasks will be filtered to include only those associated with candidate groups to which the logged-in user belongs.
- If a task is configured with candidate groups, only users belonging to those groups will see the task in their task list.

### Candidate users

- Tasks will be filtered based on candidate users specified for each task.
- If a task is configured with candidate users, only those users will see the task in their task list.

### Assignees

- Tasks assigned to a specific user will only be visible to that assigned user and to the users that belong to the candidate groups/users associated with the task.
- If the active user is assigned to a task, the task is displayed in their task list regardless of their candidate group or user status

### All users

- Tasks without candidate groups or candidate users will be visible to all users.

:::note
User groups are managed by Identity, and this resource is only available when Identity authentication is enabled.

## Zeebe client credentials

If the Zeebe Gateway is set up with Camunda Identity-based authorization, [Zeebe client OAuth environment variables](../zeebe-deployment/security/client-authorization.md#environment-variables) must be provided.
