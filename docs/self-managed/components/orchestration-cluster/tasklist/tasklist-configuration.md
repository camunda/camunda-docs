title: Configuration
---

As a Spring Boot application, Tasklist supports any standard
[Spring configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html) method.

By default, the configuration for Tasklist is stored in a YAML file `application.yml`. All Tasklist-related settings are prefixed with `camunda.tasklist`.

:::note
Configuration properties can be defined as environment variables using [Spring Boot conventions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables). To define an environment variable, convert the configuration property to uppercase, remove any dashes, and replace any delimiters (`.`) with `_`.

For example, the property `server.servlet.context-path` is represented by the environment variable `SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXT_PATH`.
:::

The following components are configurable:

## Licensing

See the [core settings documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/licensing.md).

## Webserver

See the [core settings documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/webserver.md).

## Elasticsearch or OpenSearch

Tasklist stores and reads data from Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

As of the 8.4 release, Tasklist is now compatible with [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/de/opensearch-service/) 2.5.x. Note that using Amazon OpenSearch requires [setting up a new Camunda installation](/self-managed/setup/overview.md). A migration from previous versions or Elasticsearch environments is currently not supported.

### Settings to connect

Tasklist supports [basic authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/setting-up-authentication.html) for Elasticsearch. Set the appropriate username/password combination in the configuration to use it.

#### Settings to connect to a secured Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance

To connect to a secured (https) Elasticsearch instance you need normally only set the URL protocol
part to `https` instead of `http`. A secured Elasticsearch instance needs also `username` and `password`.
The other SSL settings should only be used in case of connection problems, for example disable
host verification.

:::note
You may need to import the certificate into JVM runtime.

| camunda.tasklist.opensearch.ssl.verifyHostname  | Should the hostname be validated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | false                 |

By default, Tasklist always tries to connect to Elasticsearch. To define the database to use, the configuration below is mandatory (if this configuration is missed, Elasticsearch is used as the selected database):

| Name                      | Description                                                                                    | Default value |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| camunda.tasklist.database | Database that Tasklist is going to connect - valid values are `elasticsearch` or `opensearch`. | elasticsearch |

### Settings for shards and replicas

Tasklist creates the template with index settings named `tasklist-<version>_template` that Elasticsearch uses for all Tasklist indices. These settings can be changed.

The following configuration parameters define the settings:

| Name                                            | Description                                                    | Default value |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| camunda.tasklist.elasticsearch.numberOfShards   | How many shards Elasticsearch uses for all Tasklist indices.   | 1             |
| camunda.tasklist.elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas | How many replicas Elasticsearch uses for all Tasklist indices. | 0             |

These values are applied only on first startup of Tasklist or during version update. After the Tasklist
ELS schema is created, settings may be adjusted directly in the ELS template:

- Changes to `camunda.tasklist.elasticsearch.numberOfShards` will not be applied to existing indices and index templates.
- Changes to `camunda.tasklist.elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas` will be applied to existing indices and index templates.

:::warning

Due to a known [bug](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/issues/31238), changes to `camunda.tasklist.elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas` are currently not applied to index templates.

:::

### Settings for index templates priority

Camunda 8 creates index templates that Elasticsearch/OpenSearch uses for the historical indices. The priority of these templates can be changed.

This is useful when the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch provider has some predefined wildcard (with `*` index pattern) index templates with given priority, setting a higher priority for Tasklist index templates ensures that the correct index mappings and settings are applied on the indices created from these templates.

The following configuration parameter defines the setting:

| Name                                    | Description                                           | Default value   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| camunda.database.index.templatePriority | Priority for all index templates created by Camunda 8 | - (no priority) |

:::note
The priority should be different (strictly higher) than that set by the wildcard templates.
:::

### Snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.tasklist:
  elasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Url
    url: https://localhost:9200
    ssl:
      selfSigned: true
```

#### Disable Elasticsearch deprecation logging

When using an Elasticsearch version ≥8.16.0 it is recommended to turn off deprecation logging for the Elasticsearch cluster.

```shell
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "persistent": {
      "logger.org.elasticsearch.deprecation": "OFF"
    }
  }'
```

This setting will prevent Elasticsearch from generating excessive deprecation warning logs, such as:

```
"Deprecated field [from] used, this field is unused and will be removed entirely"
"Deprecated field [to] used, this field is unused and will be removed entirely"
"Deprecated field [include_lower] used, this field is unused and will be removed entirely"
"Deprecated field [include_upper] used, this field is unused and will be removed entirely"
```

## Zeebe Broker connection

Tasklist needs a connection to the Zeebe Broker to start the import.

### Settings to connect

For extended configuration and guidelines, refer to [secure cluster communication](../zeebe/security/secure-cluster-communication.md) and [gateway configuration](../zeebe/configuration/gateway.md).

## Zeebe Elasticsearch or OpenSearch exporter

:::note
Refer to [supported environments](../../../../reference/supported-environments.md#camunda-8-self-managed) to find out which versions of Elasticsearch or OpenSearch are supported in a Camunda 8 Self-Managed setup.
:::

For Elasticsearch, Tasklist imports data from Elasticsearch indices created and filled in by [Zeebe Elasticsearch Exporter](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/tree/main/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter). <br/>For OpenSearch, Tasklist imports data from indices created and filled in by the [Zeebe OpenSearch exporter](../zeebe/exporters/opensearch-exporter.md).

Therefore, settings for this Elasticsearch or OpenSearch connection must be defined and must correspond to the settings on the Zeebe side.

### Settings to connect and import

See also [settings to connect to a secured Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance](#settings-to-connect-to-a-secured-elasticsearch-or-opensearch-instance).

| Name                                                    | Description                                                 | Default value         |

### Snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.tasklist:
  zeebeElasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Url
    url: https://localhost:9200
    # Index prefix, configured in Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter

```

## Monitoring and health probes

Tasklist includes the [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready) inside, which
provides the number of monitoring possibilities (e.g. health check (http://localhost:9600/actuator/health) and metrics (http://localhost:9600/actuator/prometheus) endpoints).

Tasklist uses the following Actuator configuration by default:

```yaml
# disable default health indicators:
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-health-indicators
management.health.defaults.enabled: false

# enable Kubernetes health groups:
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-kubernetes-probes
management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled: true

# enable health check and metrics endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health, prometheus, loggers, usage-metrics, backups
```

With this configuration, the following endpoints are available for use out of the box:

`<server>:9600/actuator/prometheus` Prometheus metrics

`<server>:9600/actuator/health/liveness` Liveness probe

`<server>:9600/actuator/health/readiness` Readiness probe

### Example snippets to use Tasklist probes in Kubernetes

For details to set Kubernetes probes parameters, see [Kubernetes configure probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes).

#### Readiness probe as yaml config

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /actuator/health/readiness
    port: 9600
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 30
```

#### Liveness probe as yaml config

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /actuator/health/liveness
    port: 9600
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 30
```

### Distributed user sessions

If more than one Camunda Tasklist instance is accessible by users for a failover scenario, for example, persistent sessions must be configured for all instances. This enables distributed sessions among all instances and users do not lose their session when being routed to another instance.

| Name                                         | Description                                                | Default value |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| camunda.tasklist.persistent.sessions.enabled | Enables the persistence of user sessions in Elasticsearch. | false         |

## Cross-site request forgery protection

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. To mitigate this risk, Camunda provides CSRF protection that can be enabled in the Tasklist web application.

### Enabling CSRF protection

CSRF protection is enabled by default on Camunda Self-Managed. To explicitly define this, set the configuration variable `camunda.tasklist.csrfPreventionEnabled` to `true`. This is the recommended setting for production environments to enhance security.

```yaml
camunda:
  tasklist:
    csrfPreventionEnabled: true
```

When CSRF protection is enabled, the Tasklist web application requires a valid `X-CSRF-Token` header to be present in all state-changing HTTP requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

### Disabling CSRF protection

To disable CSRF protection, set the configuration property `camunda.tasklist.csrfPreventionEnabled` to `false`. This setting is not recommended for production environments as it may expose the application to CSRF attacks.

```yaml
camunda:
  tasklist:
    csrfPreventionEnabled: false
```

## Allow non-self assignment

:::info
The `allow-non-self-assignment` flag controls the behavior of the deprecated [Tasklist API](/apis-tools/tasklist-api-rest/specifications/assign-task.api.mdx).
It has no implication on the [Orchestration Cluster API](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/tutorial.md). Please refer to [access control](/components/concepts/access-control/authorizations.md#available-resources) to manage what operations can be performed by a given user or application.
:::

:::danger
This disables an intentional security mechanism and should only be used in development environments with no Identity installed.
:::

To allow users to assign other users to tasks, set the configuration property `camunda.tasklist.feature-flag.allow-non-self-assignment` to `true`.

```yaml
camunda:
  tasklist:
    feature-flag:
      allow-non-self-assignment: true
```

## Backups

You must configure the following on your chosen database:

- [Elasticsearch snapshot repository](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore.html)
- [OpenSearch snapshot repository](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/snapshot-restore/)

Tasklist is configured with the snapshot repository name to trigger database snapshots. This is important for coherent backups.

:::info
Learn more about the procedure and the need to trigger it through Camunda components in the [backup guide](/self-managed/operational-guides/backup-restore/backup-and-restore.md).
:::

Tasklist must be configured with the repository name:

| Name                                   | Description                      | Default value |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| camunda.tasklist.backup.repositoryName | ES / OS snapshot repository name | -             |

:::warning breaking change
Configuring Operate and Tasklist with different repository names will potentially create multiple backups in different repositories. Therefore, use the same `repositoryName` for both components.
