description: "Use the Camunda Exporter to export Zeebe records to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch without additional importers or data transformations."
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The Camunda Exporter exports Zeebe records directly to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch. Unlike the Elasticsearch and OpenSearch exporters, records are exported in the format required by Operate and Tasklist, and configuring additional importers or data transformations is not required.

Using the Camunda Exporter can increase process instance throughput, and can reduce the latency of changes appearing in Operate and Tasklist.

:::note
When exporting, indexes are created as required, and will not be created twice if they already exist. However, once disabled, they
will not be deleted (that is up to the administrator.) A [retention](./camunda-exporter.md?configuration=retention#options) policy can be configured to automatically delete data after a certain number of days.
:::

## Configuration

Enable the exporter by configuring the `className` in your [broker configuration](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/configuration/broker.md#zeebebrokerexporters):

```yaml
exporters:
  camundaexporter:
    className: io.camunda.exporter.CamundaExporter
    args:
    # Refer to the table below for the available args options
```

:::note
As the exporter is packaged with Zeebe, it is not necessary to specify a `jarPath`.
:::

Configure the exporter by providing `args`. See the tables below for configuration options and default values, or review the [example YAML configuration](#example).

<TabItem value="bulk">

To avoid too many expensive requests to the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster, the exporter performs batch
updates by default. The size of the batch, along with how often it should be flushed (regardless of
size) can be controlled by configuration.

| Option | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Default |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| delay  | Delay, in seconds, before force flush of the current batch. This ensures that even when we have low traffic of records, we still export every once in a while. | `5`     |
| size   | The amount of records a batch should have before we flush the batch.                                                                                           | `1000`  |

With the default configuration, the exporter will aggregate records and flush them to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch:

1. When it has aggregated 1000 records.
2. Five seconds have elapsed since the last flush (regardless of how many
   records were aggregated).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="retention">

A retention policy can be set up to delete old data.
When enabled, this creates an Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) Policy that deletes the data after the specified
`minimumAge`.
All index templates created by this exporter apply the created ILM Policy.

| Option     | Description                                                                   | Default |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| enabled    | If `true` the ILM Policy is created and applied to the index templates.       | `false` |
| minimumAge | Specifies how old the data must be, before the data is deleted as a duration. | `30d`   |
| policyName | The name of the created and applied ILM policy.                               |         |

The duration can be specified in days `d`, hours `h`, minutes `m`, seconds `s`, milliseconds `ms`, and/or nanoseconds
`nanos`.

To keep the main runtime index performant, documents are periodically moved into historical
indices. The history can be configured as follows:

| elsRolloverDateFormat     | Defines how date values are formatted for historical indices using Java DateTimeFormatter syntax. If no format is specified, the first date format defined in the field mapping is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `date`  |
| rolloverInterval          | The rollover period before an active index is rolled over. This means that `rolloveInterval` is the time gap between updates of historical indexes, therfore for a index `index-abc` and a `rolloverInterval` of 7 days (`7d`) we will have the historical indexes `index-abc-2025-01-01`, `index-abc-2025-01-08` and so on. The `elsRolloverDateFormat` must have sufficient resolution to compute the `rolloverInterval`. For example, if the `rolloverInterval` is `1h`, then the `elsRolloverDateFormat` should be `yyyy-MM-dd-HH`. Additionally, `rolloverInterval` cannot use seconds (`s`) or minutes (`m`) as units. | `1d`    |
| rolloverBatchSize         | The maximum number of instances per batch to be archived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `100`   |
| waitPeriodBeforeArchiving | Grace period during which completed process instances are excluded from archiving. For example, with a value of `1h`, any process instances completed within the last hour will not be archived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `1h`    |

| batchOperation.exportItemsOnCreation | Defines whether the pending items of a started batch operation should be exported from the beginning. For very large batch operations involving more than 100,000 process instances, this can cause temporary performance issues due to the high volume of document insertions. If set to `false`, the "has pending batch operations" spinner in the Operate UI will not function properly. | `true`  |

## Example

Here is an example configuration of the exporter:

```yaml
---
exporters:
  # Camunda Exporter ----------
  # An example configuration for the camunda exporter:
  #
  # These setting can also be overridden using the environment variables "ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAEXPORTER_..."
  # To convert a YAML formatted variable to an environment variable, start with the top-level property and separate every nested property with an underscore (_).
  # For example, the property "zeebe.broker.exporters.camundaexporter.args.index.numberOfShards" would be converted to "ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDAEXPORTER_ARGS_INDEX_NUMBEROFSHARDS".
