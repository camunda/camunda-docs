| `camunda.api.grpc.address`                                 | <p>The network address (IP address) the Camunda gRPC API server binds to and listens on.</p><p>The default value is `0.0.0.0`, meaning the gRPC server will:</p><ul><li>Listen on all available network interfaces</li><li>Accept connections from any IP address that can reach the server</li><li>Be accessible from both localhost and external networks (depending on firewall/network configuration)</li></ul><p>This property is part of the API configuration for the Orchestration Cluster and controls network connectivity for gRPC-based client applications that need to communicate with Camunda, such as Camunda clients using the Java gRPC client library, external applications making gRPC calls to the Camunda engine, and inter-service communication in distributed deployments.</p><p>You can change this to a specific IP address (such as `127.0.0.1` for localhost only) if you want to restrict which network interfaces the gRPC server accepts connections on for security purposes.</p> | `0.0.0.0`                   |
| `camunda.api.grpc.port`                                    | <p>The port number that the Camunda gRPC API server listens on for incoming connections.</p><p>The default value is `26500`, meaning the gRPC server will accept client connections on port 26500. This port is used by:</p><ul><li>Camunda clients using gRPC libraries (Java, Go, Node.js, and so on)</li><li>External applications making gRPC calls to the Camunda engine</li><li>Inter-service communication in distributed deployments</li><li>Any gRPC-based integrations with the Camunda platform</li></ul><p>This works in conjunction with camunda.api.grpc.address to define the complete network endpoint (address:port) where the gRPC API server is accessible. For example, with the default settings, the gRPC server would be available at 0.0.0.0:26500.</p><p>You can change this port if you need to avoid conflicts with other services or comply with specific network configurations in your environment.</p>                                                                                | `26500`                     |
| `camunda.api.grpc.min-keep-alive-interval`                 | <p>The minimum time interval that must pass between keep-alive ping messages sent by gRPC clients to the Camunda gRPC server.</p><p>The default value is `30s` (30 seconds), meaning the server will only allow clients to send keep-alive pings if at least 30 seconds have passed since the last ping. This setting helps prevent clients from overwhelming the server with too-frequent keep-alive messages while still maintaining connection health.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `30s`                       |
| `camunda.api.grpc.max-message-size`                        | <p>The maximum size limit for individual gRPC messages that can be sent or received by the Camunda gRPC API server.</p><p>If clients try to send messages larger than this limit, or if the server tries to respond with data exceeding this size, the gRPC call will fail with an error. You can increase this value if you need to handle larger messages, but be mindful of memory usage and network performance implications.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `30MB`                      |
| `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.enabled`                             | <p>Controls whether SSL/TLS encryption is enabled for the Camunda gRPC API server.</p><p>The default value is `true`, meaning this property:</p><ul><li>Enables SSL/TLS encryption for all gRPC communications between clients and the Camunda server</li><li>Secures data in transit by encrypting all messages sent over the gRPC connection</li><li>Requires SSL certificates to be configured (via properties such as `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate` and `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate-private-key`)</li><li>Ensures secure communication for production environments</li></ul><p>When SSL is enabled, clients must connect using secure gRPC connections (typically using `grpcs://` protocol instead of `grpc://`).</p><p>If you set this to `false`, the gRPC server will accept unencrypted connections, which should only be used in development environments or secure internal networks.</p>                                                                                                      | `true`                      |
| `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate`                         | <p>The file path to the SSL/TLS certificate file that the Camunda gRPC API server uses for encrypted connections.</p><p>This property is used when SSL/TLS is enabled (via `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.enabled=true`) and defines:</p><ul><li>Certificate file location: Points to the SSL certificate file (typically a `.pem`, `.crt`, or `.cert` file)</li><li>Server identity: The certificate identifies the server to clients and enables encrypted communication</li><li>Trust establishment: Clients use this certificate to verify they're connecting to the legitimate Camunda server</li></ul><p>You need to replace the default value with the actual path to your SSL certificate file. This certificate works together with the private key (specified in `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate-private-key`) to establish secure gRPC connections.</p>                                                                                                                                                          | `/path/to/my/cert.pem`      |
| `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate-private-key`             | <p>The file path to the private key file that corresponds to the SSL/TLS certificate used by the Camunda gRPC API server.</p><p>This property works in conjunction with `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate` to establish secure SSL/TLS connections.</p><p>You need to replace the default value with the actual path to your private key file (typically a `.key`, `.pem`, or similar file format).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `/path`                     |
| `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.key-store.file-path`                 | <p>The file path to a Java KeyStore file that contains SSL/TLS certificates and private keys for the Camunda gRPC API server.</p><p>This property provides an alternative to using separate certificate and private key files. Instead of configuring `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate` and `camunda.api.grpc.ssl.certificate-private-key` separately, you can use a KeyStore file that bundles both the certificate and private key together.</p><p>You need to replace this with the actual path to your KeyStore file (typically a `.jks`, `.p12`, or `.pfx` file).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `/path/to/keystore`         |

## CSRF Protection

The following variables are used to configure [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/csrf-protection.md) protection.
The CSRF protection only applies in the context of a session-based authentication. You don't need to provide
CSRF tokens when using OIDC or Basic authentication methods.

:::caution
Disabling CSRF protection is not recommended for production environments as it leaves your application vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.
