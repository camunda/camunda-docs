Use groups to manage and organize user access to Camunda 8 management components (Web Modeler, Console, and Optimize).

## About groups

Organize your users into groups as an efficient and scalable way of controlling access to Camunda 8 management components.

- Instead of assigning roles to individual users, [map a set of roles to a group](#assign-roles-to-a-group).
- All group members automatically inherit the role permissions of a group.

:::note
You do not create or manage users in Management Identity itself. Users are managed in Keycloak or your connected IdP.
