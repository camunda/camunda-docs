The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.8.x to 8.9.x.

## Web Modeler

### Cluster configuration

#### Logging framework changed

Web Modeler's `restapi` component now uses [Apache Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for logging.

See [this migration guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/migrate-from-logback.html) to learn about the changes you may need to make if you are using a custom Logback configuration.

### Logging configuration

The default logging configuration is included inline for quick reference.

The default layout displays **time only**, thread name, MDC context, log level, logger name, and message.

#### Example pattern

```perl
%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %notEmpty{[%X] }%-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

See [Logging](/self-managed/components/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/logging.md) for advanced settings and more details.
