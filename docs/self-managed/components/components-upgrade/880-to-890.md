The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.8.x to 8.9.x.

## Web Modeler

### Cluster configuration

#### Changed logging framework

Web Modeler's `restapi` component uses the [Apache Log4j 2 framework](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.12.x/index.html/) for logging.

Follow [this guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/migrate-from-logback.html) to understand what changes you might need to make if you are using a custom logback configuration.

See our [logging documentation](/self-managed/components/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/logging.md) for more details about the existing configuration.

### Logging

#### Default configuration

The default logging configuration is included inline for quick reference.

The default layout shows **time only**, thread name, MDC context, log level, logger name, and message.

**Example pattern:**

```perl
%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %notEmpty{[%X] }%-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

See the [full logging documentation](/self-managed/components/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/logging.md) for advanced settings and details.
