---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x.

## Camunda Exporter and harmonized data model

The following Camunda 8.7 to 8.8 update guide covers changes related to the new harmonized data model, and the newly introduced [Camunda Exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/camunda-exporter.md).
For additional details about the introduced exporter and related changes, see the [8.8 announcements](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/880-announcements.md).

:::important
With the Camunda Exporter introduction, Camunda is compatible with Elasticsearch 8.16+ and no longer supports older Elasticsearch versions. See [supported environments](/reference/supported-environments.md).
:::

### Ensure the exporter/import backlog is small

For data from 8.7 to be imported, the importers must run first and complete before the Camunda Exporter can start.

The importer reads data from existing Zeebe Elasticsearch indices, and when it detects data from newer versions, it marks itself as complete. The Camunda Exporter then starts exporting only when the importer is done.

:::important
To reduce the potential of building a backlog, the user needs to make sure to drain the backlog queue as much as possible before the update.

Otherwise, the backlog can increase and cause web application data to become out of date. Zeebe
will be not able to clean up data, potentially running out of disc space. This will produce downtime.
:::

The backlog can be validated via the following Prometheus metrics:

- `operate_import_time_seconds_sum`
- `operate_import_time_seconds_count`

For example, the following query shows the import latency. If the result is in a range of seconds (ideally below 10 seconds), it is fine to update.

```promql
sum(rate(operate_import_time_seconds_sum{namespace=~"$namespace", partition=~"$partition", pod=~"$pod"}[$__rate_interval]))
/ sum(rate(operate_import_time_seconds_count{namespace=~"$namespace", partition=~"$partition", pod=~"$pod"}[$__rate_interval]))
```

### Data migration

To enable Tasklist to utilize the new harmonized indices, Camunda 8.8 provides a migration application to enhance existing process models. This migration application runs asynchronously to the other applications until the importers are done, and ensures that all processes created in 8.7 are migrated and enhanced.

The migration application can be found in the `camunda/bin/process-migration` directory. It can be run locally, against the same Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance, separate/standalone or together with the rest of the Camunda 8 application.

The migration application expects the following configuration:

```yaml
camunda:
  migration:
    process:
      # How many processes are migrated at once
      batchSize: 5
      # The timeout/count down after importer has finished before the migration app should stop
      # Default PT1M
      importerFinishedTimeout: PT1M
      # Retry properties, exponential backoff
      retry:
        # How many times do we retry failing operations until we stop the migration process
        maxRetries: 5
        # The minimum retry delay applied to backoff
        # Default PT1S
        minRetryDelay: PT10S
        # The maximum retry delay applied to backoff
        # Default PT1M
        maxRetryDelay: PT1M
  database:
    connect:
      type: elasticsearch
      # URL of ES cluster
      url: <ES CLUSTER CONNECTION>
      # Cluster name of ES cluster
      clusterName: <CLUSTER NAME>
```

The migration application exposes prometheus metrics (as other components) under the `:9600/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. This allows the user following up the migration process.

Useful metrics are:

- `camunda_migration_processes_migrated` - Number of migrated processes so far
- `camunda_migration_processes_rounds` - Number of migration rounds performed so far
- `camunda_migration_processes_round_time` - Time taken to complete one migration round
- `camunda_migration_processes_single_process_time` - Time taken to process a single process definition

#### Standalone Migration (locally)

When running the application separately (locally for example), the configuration must be made public to the migration application.

For example, the location of the `application.yaml` can be provided for local execution:

```shell
SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONALLOCATION=/path/to/application.yaml ./camunda/bin/process-migration
```

#### Integration in the standalone Camunda application

When running the standalone Camunda application, the migration application can be executed inside. It can be enabled via the `process-migration` Spring profile.

**Example Spring profile configuration:**

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: "operate,tasklist,broker,auth,process-migration"
```

:::note
The above configuration must be made in the related `application.yaml` of the standalone Camunda application.
:::

#### Helm charts

When using the Camunda 8 Helm charts, the migration application will automatically deploy with the importers if the user is enabling the update path.

### Turn off importers after completion

:::note
In 8.8, the Operate and Tasklist importers are disabled by default.  
When upgrading, enable them by setting:

- `camunda.operate.importerEnabled=true`
- `camunda.tasklist.importerEnabled=true`
  :::

Importers are only necessary at the start of the migration. Once complete, they can be safely turned off.

To detect whether importers are done, users can validate the state in the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch index:

- `tasklist-import-position-8.2.0_`
- `operate-import-position-8.3.0_`

If all entries show the `completed` property set to `true`, the importing is done.

Alternatively, metrics can be validated via:

- `operate_import_completed`
- `tasklist_import_completed`

These properties can be used in the following example query:

```
sum(tasklist_import_completed{namespace="$namespace"}) by (importPositionAlias)
```

### Update any custom prefixes

:::important
This step is required if you use an installation with custom prefixes.
:::

The new harmonized index schema introduces one common index prefix. To update to Camunda 8.8, existing indices using custom prefixes must be migrated to a common prefix, so the Camunda Exporter, REST API, and other consumers can be configured correctly.

#### Prefix migration

:::warning
Disk usage will massively increase while the migration is ongoing (and will return to normal when complete).
Ensure you have at least double the disk space free.
:::

:::note
It is recommended that you first back up the database, and test the migration script in a test environment to ensure there are no unexpected issues.
:::

:::note
The prefix migration involves downtime, as all data in the secondary storage needs to be migrated to a different prefix, and writes need to be stopped in between.
:::

Complete the following steps to migrate any custom prefixes:

1. Shut down your Camunda 8.7 cluster (for example, reduce the replicas to zero). No traffic can be executed against your to-be-migrated ES/OS prefixes.
2. In the `camunda/bin` directory, the `prefix-migration` script will execute the prefix migration, which can be executed locally.
   Pass the desired prefix using the `CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX` environment variable.

   1. Make sure that your configuration in `camunda/config` has set the previous custom prefixes, and your configuration is made public to the script (for example, using `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONALLOCATION=/path/to/application.yaml ./camunda/bin/prefix-migration`).
   2. Alternatively, you can set the configuration via environment variables:

   ```shell
   export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-operate-prefix; \
   export CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-tasklist-prefix; \
   export CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX=some-new-prefix; \
   ./prefix-migration
   ```

With the migration finished, the following configuration changes must be made prior to updating to 8.8.

:::note
Without these configuration changes, the update to 8.8 will fail.
:::

Given a new desired prefix of `some-new-prefix`:

- Set `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` to `some-new-prefix`.
- Set `CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` to `some-new-prefix`.
- Set `ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDA_ARGS_CONNECT_INDEXPREFIX` (the prefix for the new [Camunda exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/camunda-exporter.md)) to `some-new-prefix`.

### Single Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instance

Using more than one isolated Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instance for exported Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist data is no longer supported. If your environment uses multiple Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instances, you must manually migrate the data from each to a single Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster before updating to Camunda 8.8. The migration should target Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist indices, index templates, aliases, and ILM policies.

:::important
This step must be performed before all other migration steps.
:::

## Orchestration Cluster REST API

### Removed deprecated OpenAPI objects

:::warning
With the Camunda 8.8 release, deprecated API objects containing number keys have been removed, including the
corresponding `application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json` content type header.
:::

In previous releases, entity keys were transitioned from `integer (int64)` to `string` types, and deprecated
`integer (int64)` keys were still supported. As of the 8.8 release, support for `integer (int64)` keys has been removed.

To update to Camunda 8.8, API objects using `integer (int64)` keys must be updated to use `string` keys and the
`application/json` header.

For more information about the key attribute type change, see
the [8.7 API key attributes overview][camunda8-api-overview].

[camunda8-api-overview]: /versioned_docs/version-8.7/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/camunda-api-rest-overview.md#api-key-attributes

### Streamlined variable OpenAPI objects

The OpenAPI specification streamlines the objects used for variable filtering in search requests. The supported Camunda Java client handles those changes transparently. The affected API endpoints are alpha feature endpoints and thus already marked as subject to change in 8.6 and 8.7.

If you are generating a custom REST client using the specification, consider the following changes:

- The unified `VariableValueFilterProperty` replaces the `ProcessInstanceVariableFilterRequest` and `UserTaskVariableFilterRequest` in the OpenAPI spec.
- For naming consistency, the `UserTaskVariableFilter` replaces the `VariableUserTaskFilterRequest`.

## Exported records

### `USER_TASK` records

To support [user task listeners](/components/concepts/user-task-listeners.md), some backward incompatible changes were necessary to the exported `USER_TASK` records.

#### `assignee` no longer provided in `CREATED` event

Previously, when a user task was activating with a specified `assignee`,
we appended the following events of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` property as provided

The `ASSIGNING` and `ASSIGNED` events were not appended in this case.

To support the new User Task Listeners feature, the `assignee` value will not be filled in the `CREATED` event anymore.

With 8.8, the following events are now appended:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `ASSIGNING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `ASSIGNED` with `assignee` property as provided

#### `ASSIGNING` has become `CLAIMING` for `CLAIM` operation

When claiming a user task, we previously appended the following records of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CLAIM`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

A new `CLAIMING` intent was introduced to distinguish between claiming and regular assigning.
We now append the following records when claiming a user task:

- `CLAIM`
- `CLAIMING`
- `ASSIGNED`

The `ASSIGNING` event is still appended for assigning a user task.
In that case, we append the following records:

- `ASSIGN`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

### Zeebe record types

With the introduction of the Camunda Exporter, the Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Exporter no longer export all record types by default. Therefore, not all `zeebe-record` indices will be populated.

:::note
This only affects records exported with the 8.8 version. During the migration, leftover 8.7 records are exported as normal.
:::

The record types that continue to be exported by default are the following:

- `DEPLOYMENT`
- `PROCESS`
- `PROCESS_INSTANCE`
- `VARIABLE`
- `USER_TASK`
- `INCIDENT`
- `JOB`

To export other record types, review `includeEnabledRecords` for [Elasticsearch](../orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md#configuration) or [OpenSearch](../orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/opensearch-exporter.md#configuration) exporter configuration.

### Exporter deletion

Exporter configuration removal no longer deletes the exporter from the system. Instead, the exporter enters a blocked state to safeguard against data loss caused by accidental or manual configuration changes. To permanently remove an exporter, use the [Exporters API](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/operations/management-api.md).

## Connectors

### Email connector

Starting with the 8.8 release, angle brackets (`<` and `>`) are no longer removed from the `messageId`.
