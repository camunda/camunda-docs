The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x.

## Camunda Orchestration Cluster Identity Migration

Camunda 8.8 introduces Orchestration Cluster Identity as a separate component within the Orchestration Cluster, you can learn more about it [here](../../../reference/announcements-release-notes/880/whats-new-in-88.md#identity-and-management-identity).

To ease the effort for migrating data from [Management Identity](../management-identity/overview.md) to the new [Orchestration Cluster Identity](../orchestration-cluster/identity/overview.md), a Identity Migration Application is provided.

:::warning RBA Migration Impact
If you use Resource-Based Authorization (RBA) and have users assigned to roles with `zeebe-api:write` permissions (especially the default Zeebe role) as well as other roles where RBA applies, then after migration these users will have wildcard permissions for the corresponding authorizations. This means access will not be restricted to specific resources in Tasklist or Operate while the user remains a member of this role.
:::

### Running the Identity Migration Application

The application can be run [locally for manual setups](../../deployment/manual/install.md) or from a docker container.

#### Running the migration natively

Using the native distribution of Camunda 8, you can run the Identity Migration Application as follows:

<Tabs groupId="os" defaultValue="maclinux" values={
[
{ label: 'Mac OS + Linux', value: 'maclinux', },
{ label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
] }>
<TabItem value="maclinux">

```bash
./bin/identity-migration
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">
```bash
./bin/identity-migration.bat
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Running the migration using the `camunda/camunda:8.8.0` docker image.

You can run the Identity Migration Application by overriding the default entrypoint of the official Camunda 8 Docker image to `/usr/local/camunda/bin/identity-migration`, e.g. as such:

```
docker run --entrypoint /usr/local/camunda/bin/identity-migration camunda/camunda:8.8.0
```

#### Monitor completion

You can verify completion of the identity migration by checking for the following log entries:

```
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.AuthorizationMigrationHandler - Authorization migration complete: Created {num} out of {num} authorizations. Skipped {num} as they already exist.
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.ClientMigrationHandler - Client authorization migration complete: Created {num} out of {num} authorizations. Skipped {num} as they already exist.
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.MappingRuleMigrationHandler - Mapping rule migration completed: Created {num} out of {num} mapping rules, the remaining existed already. Assigned {num} roles out of {num} attempted, the remaining were already assigned. Assigned  tenants out of {num} attempted, the remaining were already assigned.
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.RoleMigrationHandler - Role Migration completed: Created {num} roles out of {num} total roles.
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.TenantMigrationHandler - Tenant migration completed: Created {num} out of {num} tenants, the remaining existed already.
INFO io.camunda.migration.identity.handler.sm.UserRoleMigrationHandler - Tenant migration completed: User Role membership migration completed: Assigned {num} roles out of {num} roles.
```

### Configuration of the Identity Migration application

The Identity Migration Application supports two scenarios to migrate from, each of those requires different configuration properties and values to be set.

Configuration can generally be set by directly modifying the application.yaml The default location of the config within the Camunda 8 distribution is `./config/application.yaml` and `/usr/local/camunda/config/application.yaml` in the docker image respectively.

Alternatively all properties can also be set via Environment variables.

#### Common configuration for the Identity Migration application

The Identity Migration Application needs to join the Orchestraction Cluster in order to create Identity Access Management records, the values can be taken from equivalent configuration of the Orchestration Cluster nodes.

Furthermore the Identity Migration Application requires full access to the [Management Identity](../management-identity/overview.md) API and thus valid client credentials for a client with `read` permissions to access it.

  <TabItem value="helm" label="Helm Chart">

In the Helm chart deployments, the Identity Migration app runs as a **Kubernetes job** that operates independently from other migration processes. Key characteristics include:

- **Idempotent operation**: Safe to rerun multiple times without creating duplicates
- **Standalone execution**: Runs separately from the data migration process
- **Clear error reporting**: Provides detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **One-time setup**: Once successful, you can safely clean up the migration resources

#### Migration client setup

The migration requires a dedicated Keycloak client with read-only access to your Identity Resource Server.

When you enable the Identity migration, the Camunda Helm chart automatically configures the required `migration` client for you. This client can be removed as part of the post migration tasks when the Identity migration is complete.

#### Entity IDs configuration

When migrating entities from Management Identity to the Orchestration Cluster, the Identity Migration Application must convert IDs from the source so that they are valid in the target Orchestration Cluster. It does so by applying the following conversions:

- Lowercase
- Replace any character that does not fall into the class `[a-z0-9_@.-]` with an underscore character (`_`)

You can use the following properties to customize this conversion process:

### Manual migration instructions

#### Roles & Application Permissions

Permissions formerly assigned to [Management Identity Roles](../../../../versioned_docs/version-8.7/self-managed/identity/access-management/manage-permissions.md#assign-a-permission-to-a-role) and [Management Identity Applications](../../../../versioned_docs/version-8.7/self-managed/identity/access-management/manage-permissions.md#assign-a-permission-to-an-application) require the following equivalent [Orchestration Cluster Identity Authorizations](../../../components/identity/authorization.md) setup.

You need to manually recreate the [Roles](../../../components/identity/role.md) you need and grant them the equivalent Authorizations for the former [Management Identity Permission](../management-identity/access-management/access-management-overview.md) as follows:

##### User Role membership

You can recreate [Management Identity Role memberships](../management-identity/application-user-group-role-management/manage-roles.md) using the [Orchestration Cluster Identity Role Management](../../../components/identity/role.md#assign-users-to-a-role).

#### Groups

You can recreate Groups setup in the [Management Identity Groups](../management-identity/application-user-group-role-management/manage-groups.md) using the [Orchestration Cluster Identity Group Management](../../../components/identity/group.md).

Alernatively you can make use of the [Bring your own Groups feature](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/identity/connect-external-identity-provider.md#optional-step-8-configure-bring-your-own-groups) and just recreate the [Orchestration Cluster Authorization Records](../../../components/identity/authorization.md) granting permissions to those groups. This is what the Identity Migration Application defaults to.

#### Resource Authorizations

The former [Management Identity Resource Authorizations](../../../../versioned_docs/version-8.7/self-managed/identity/access-management/resource-authorizations.md) are replaced with a more fine grained [Orchestration Cluster Authorization Management](../../../components/identity/authorization.md).

## Camunda Exporter and harmonized data model

The following Camunda 8.7 to 8.8 update guide covers changes related to the new harmonized data model, and the newly introduced [Camunda Exporter](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/camunda-exporter.md).
For additional details about the introduced exporter and related changes, see the [8.8 announcements](/reference/announcements-release-notes/880/880-announcements.md).

:::important
With the Camunda Exporter introduction, Camunda is compatible with Elasticsearch 8.16+ and no longer supports older Elasticsearch versions. See [supported environments](/reference/supported-environments.md).
:::

### Ensure the exporter/import backlog is small

For data from 8.7 to be imported, the importers must run first and complete before the Camunda Exporter can start.

The importer reads data from existing Zeebe Elasticsearch indices, and when it detects data from newer versions, it marks itself as complete. The Camunda Exporter then starts exporting only when the importer is done.

:::important
To reduce the potential of building a backlog, the user needs to make sure to drain the backlog queue as much as possible before the update.

Otherwise, the backlog can increase and cause web application data to become out of date. Zeebe
will be not able to clean up data, potentially running out of disc space. This will produce downtime.
:::

The backlog can be validated via the following Prometheus metrics:

- `operate_import_time_seconds_sum`
- `operate_import_time_seconds_count`

For example, the following query shows the import latency. If the result is in a range of seconds (ideally below 10 seconds), it is fine to update.

```promql
sum(rate(operate_import_time_seconds_sum{namespace=~"$namespace", partition=~"$partition", pod=~"$pod"}[$__rate_interval]))
/ sum(rate(operate_import_time_seconds_count{namespace=~"$namespace", partition=~"$partition", pod=~"$pod"}[$__rate_interval]))
```

### Data migration

Camunda 8.8 provides dedicated migration applications to ensure data integrity and compatibility during upgrades. Upgrades must be performed sequentially through each minor version (for example, 8.6 → 8.7 → 8.8), as skipping versions is not supported.

The migration applications are located in the `camunda/bin/` directory. You can run them locally, targeting the same Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance, either as standalone tools or alongside the rest of the Camunda 8 application. You can also use the `data-migration` binary which wraps all the migrations in a single application (excluding `identity-migration`).

Data migration requires a configured [secondary storage](../../components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/properties.md##data---secondary-storage). All migrations share the same base configuration but can be individually adjusted as needed. Prometheus metrics for migration progress are exposed at the `:9600/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.

For details about each migration, see the sections below.

<Tabs groupId="migrations" defaultValue="process" values={
[
{ label: 'Process Migration', value: 'process', },
{ label: 'Task Migration', value: 'tasklist', },
{ label: 'Metrics Migration', value: 'metrics', },
] }>

<TabItem value="process">

#### Scope

The process migration component unifies the previously separate `operate-process` and `tasklist-process` indices. To achieve this, it extracts the Camunda Form–related data from deployments that was previously used only by Tasklist.

_Depends on the Operate importer being completed._

#### Configuration

Spring profile: `process-migration`

```yaml
camunda:
  migration:
    process:
      # How many process definitions are processed per round
      # Default 20
      batchSize: 5
      # The timeout/count down after importer has finished before the migration app should stop
      # Default PT1M
      importerFinishedTimeout: PT1M
      # The timeout for the migration
      # Default PT2H
      timeout: PT2H
      # Retry properties, exponential backoff
      retry:
        # How many times do we retry failing operations until we stop the migration process
        maxRetries: 5
        # The minimum retry delay applied to backoff
        # Default PT1S
        minRetryDelay: PT10S
        # The maximum retry delay applied to backoff
        # Default PT1M
        maxRetryDelay: PT1M
```

#### Exposed metrics

- `camunda_migration_processes_migrated` - Number of migrated processes so far
- `camunda_migration_processes_rounds` - Number of migration rounds performed so far
- `camunda_migration_processes_round_time` - Time taken to complete one migration round
- `camunda_migration_processes_single_process_time` - Time taken to process a single process definition

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tasklist">

#### Scope

This migration component updates the `tasklist-task` runtime and dated indices to remove the `dynamic:true` requirement from the `tasklist-task.customHeaders` field mapping.

:::note
This migration also upgrades all the `tasklist-task` indices to 8.8.0. The original runtime `tasklist-task` index (8.5.0) is retained for data safety. If cluster retention is enabled, an ILM or ISM policy is applied to this original runtime index (8.5.0) for the configured retention period (default: 30 days).
:::

_Depends on theTasklist importer being completed._

##### :warning: Side effects

Because this migration actively moves data from indices, some temporary side effects may occur in the Orchestration Cluster:

- Some tasks may not be visible in the Tasklist UI or returned by the Tasklist API.
- With **Tasklist API v1**, some tasks cannot be assigned, unassigned, or completed. These requests return `404 Not Found`.
- With **Tasklist API v2**, tasks can be assigned, unassigned, or completed, but attempts to retrieve them (for example, via search) may return `500 Internal Server Error`.
- Refreshing the Tasklist UI while a task is selected may return `404 Not Found` if the task is still being migrated.
- Refreshing the Tasklist UI while a task is selected may return `500 Internal Server Error` if the task was completed or reassigned via API v2 but not yet fully migrated.
- Archiving is disabled during this period.

These issues resolve automatically once migration is complete.

#### Configuration

Spring profile: `task-migration`

```yaml
camunda:
  migration:
    tasks:
      # How many tasks are processed per round
      # Default 20
      batchSize: 20
      # Retention age for the old `tasklist-task-8.5.0` runtime index. Applies only if global retention is enabled
      # Default 30d
      legacyIndexRetentionAge: 30d
      # Retry properties, exponential backoff
      retry:
        maxRetries: 5
        minRetryDelay: PT10S
        maxRetryDelay: PT1M
```

#### Exposed metrics

- `camunda_migration_tasks_migrated` - Number of tasks processed so far
- `camunda_migration_tasks_rounds` - Total number of task batch update rounds
- `camunda_migration_tasks_round_time` - Duration of a task batch migration
- `camunda_migration_tasks_single_task_time` - Duration to process a single task

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="metrics">

#### Scope

This migration component transfers existing usage metrics from Operate and Tasklist into the new data structure of their respective indices.

It consists of two parts: Operate metrics and Tasklist usage metrics, referenced as `metrics` and `tu-metrics` in the configuration.

_Each migration depends on it's corresponding importer being completed._

#### Configuration

Spring profile: `usage-metric-migration`

```yaml
camunda:
  migration:
    metrics:
      timeout: PT2H
      retry:
        maxRetries: 5
        minRetryDelay: PT10S
        maxRetryDelay: PT1M
    tu-metrics:
      timeout: PT2H
      retry:
        maxRetries: 5
        minRetryDelay: PT10S
        maxRetryDelay: PT1M
```

#### Exposed metrics

- `camunda_migration_operate_reindex_time` - Duration to reindex the Operate metrics index
- `camunda_migration_operate_task_importer_finished` - Duration until the Operate importer finishes
- `camunda_migration_tasklist_reindex_time` - Duration to reindex the Tasklist metrics index
- `camunda_migration_tasklist_task_importer_finished` - Duration until the Tasklist importer finishes

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Standalone Migration (locally)

When running the application separately (locally for example), the configuration must be made public to the migration application.

For example, the location of the `application.yaml` can be provided for local execution:

```shell
SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONALLOCATION=/path/to/application.yaml ./camunda/bin/process-migration
```

#### Integration in the standalone Camunda application

When running the standalone Camunda application, any migration application can be executed within it. You can enable it using the respective Spring profile.

#### Monitor completion

Apart from the respective exposed Prometheus metrics, completion of the data migration can also be verified from the log output. Example:

```
INFO io.camunda.migration.task.TaskMigrator - Task Migration completed successfully
INFO io.camunda.migration.process.ProcessMigrator - Process Migration completed
INFO io.camunda.migration.usagemetric.OperateMetricMigrator - Reindex task {id} completed successfully
INFO io.camunda.migration.usagemetric.TasklistMetricMigrator - Reindex task {id} completed successfully
```

### Turn off importers after completion

Importers are only necessary until the migration is successfully completed. Then, they can be safely turned off.

:::note
You can enable the importers by setting:

```yaml
camunda.operate.importerEnabled: true
camunda.tasklist.importerEnabled: true
```

:::

To detect whether importers are done, users can validate the state in the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch index:

- `tasklist-import-position-8.2.0_`
- `operate-import-position-8.3.0_`

If all entries show the `completed` property set to `true`, the importing is done.

Alternatively, metrics can be validated via:

- `operate_import_completed`
- `tasklist_import_completed`

These properties can be used in the following example query:

```
sum(tasklist_import_completed{namespace="$namespace"}) by (importPositionAlias)
```

![metrics-import-complete](./img/import-complete-metrics.png)

### Update any custom prefixes

The new harmonized index schema introduces one common index prefix. To update to Camunda 8.8, existing indices using custom prefixes must be migrated to a common prefix, so the Camunda Exporter, REST API, and other consumers can be configured correctly.

#### Prefix migration

:::caution
This step is required if your installation consists of custom prefixed indices.

Prefix migration modifies the secondary storage in preparation for the Camunda 8.8 update. These changes are irreversible, so creating a cluster backup is required. To ensure data integrity, prefix migration must be performed during downtime. All data in the secondary storage must be migrated to a new prefix, and no access to Camunda indices should occur during this window.

**Do not restart the cluster on the previous Camunda 8.7 version.**
:::

Complete the following steps to migrate any custom prefixes:

1. Shut down your Camunda 8.7 cluster (for example, reduce the replicas to zero). No traffic can be executed against your to-be-migrated ES/OS prefixes.
2. In the `camunda/bin` directory, the `prefix-migration` script will execute the prefix migration, which can be executed locally.
   1. Make sure that your configuration in `camunda/config` has set the previous custom prefixes, and your configuration is made public to the script (for example, using `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONALLOCATION=/path/to/application.yaml ./camunda/bin/prefix-migration`).
   2. Alternatively, you can set the configuration via environment variables

Example execution of the prefix migration:
<Tabs groupId="prefix-db" defaultValue="elasticsearch" values={
[
{ label: 'Elasticsearch', value: 'elasticsearch', },
{ label: 'OpenSearch', value: 'opensearch', },
] }>
<TabItem value="elasticsearch">

Environment variables configuration:

```shell
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-operate-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-tasklist-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEXPREFIX=some-new-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200 ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch ;\
./bin/prefix-migration
```

YAML file configuration:

```yaml
camunda:
  tasklist:
    elasticsearch-index-prefix: old-tasklist-prefix
  operate:
    elasticsearch-index-prefix: old-operate-prefix
  data:
    secondary-storage:
      type: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch:
        url: http://localhost:9200
        index-prefix: some-new-prefix
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="opensearch">

Environment variables configuration:

```shell
export CAMUNDA_OPERATE_OPENSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-operate-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_OPENSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=old-tasklist-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_OPENSEARCH_INDEXPREFIX=some-new-prefix ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_OPENSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200 ;\
export CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARYSTORAGE_TYPE=opensearch ;\
./bin/prefix-migration
```

YAML file configuration:

```yaml
camunda:
  tasklist:
    opensearch-index-prefix: old-tasklist-prefix
  operate:
    opensearch-index-prefix: old-operate-prefix
  data:
    secondary-storage:
      type: opensearch
      opensearch:
        url: http://localhost:9200
        index-prefix: some-new-prefix
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
If a custom prefix is supplied for only one of Tasklist or Operate, set it on the respective `index-prefix` parameter.
:::

After the prefix migration completes, your secondary storage is ready to proceed with the update to Camunda 8.8.

Once the migration is finished, apply the following configuration changes before updating to version 8.8.

Given a new desired prefix of `some-new-prefix`:

```
CAMUNDA_DATA_SECONDARY-STORAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEXPREFIX=some-new-prefix
ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDA_ARGS_CONNECT_INDEXPREFIX=some-new-prefix
```

### Single Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instance

Using more than one isolated Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instance for exported Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist data is no longer supported. If your environment uses multiple Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instances, you must manually migrate the data from each to a single Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster before updating to Camunda 8.8. The migration should target Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist indices, index templates, aliases, and ILM policies.

:::important
This step must be performed before all other migration steps.
:::

## Orchestration Cluster REST API

### Removed deprecated OpenAPI objects

:::warning
With the Camunda 8.8 release, deprecated API objects containing number keys have been removed, including the
corresponding `application/vnd.camunda.api.keys.number+json` content type header.
:::

In previous releases, entity keys were transitioned from `integer (int64)` to `string` types, and deprecated
`integer (int64)` keys were still supported. As of the 8.8 release, support for `integer (int64)` keys has been removed.

To update to Camunda 8.8, API objects using `integer (int64)` keys must be updated to use `string` keys and the
`application/json` header.

For more information about the key attribute type change, see
the [8.7 API key attributes overview][camunda8-api-overview].

[camunda8-api-overview]: /versioned_docs/version-8.7/apis-tools/camunda-api-rest/camunda-api-rest-overview.md#api-key-attributes

### Streamlined variable OpenAPI objects

The OpenAPI specification streamlines the objects used for variable filtering in search requests. The supported Camunda Java client handles those changes transparently. The affected API endpoints are alpha feature endpoints and thus already marked as subject to change in 8.6 and 8.7.

If you are generating a custom REST client using the specification, consider the following changes:

- The unified `VariableValueFilterProperty` replaces the `ProcessInstanceVariableFilterRequest` and `UserTaskVariableFilterRequest` in the OpenAPI spec.
- For naming consistency, the `UserTaskVariableFilter` replaces the `VariableUserTaskFilterRequest`.

## Web application permission migration

With the changes to the [authorization system](/components/concepts/access-control/authorizations.md), access control for public APIs and component UIs has been updated.

As a result, existing user and client permissions must be adjusted to continue using deprecated component API endpoints, as well as to retain visibility of information in applications and perform operations.

### Migrate Operate V1 endpoint permissions

A detailed guide for migrating permissions for the V1 API endpoints can be found in the [public API migration guides](/apis-tools/migration-manuals/migrate-component-apis.md).

### Migrate Operate and Tasklist access permissions

The new permissions define what is displayed to users and which actions can be performed in the component UIs. They provide more fine-grained control, for example, granting a user read access to only a specific process.

To maintain the same access, views and control over modifications in the Operate and Tasklist UI as in previous versions, either run the [Identity migration application](#running-the-identity-migration-application) or refer to the [manual migration instructions](#roles--application-permissions).

:::important
The authorization concept for batch operations in Operate has changed from user-based permissions to the new resource permissions. After the upgrade users will not be able to see batch operations anymore (including their own) unless they were explicitly given read permissions on all batch operations.
:::

To fully leverage the new authorizations and customize access, refer to the access control documentation for [Operate](/components/operate/userguide/access-control.md) and [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/userguide/access-control.md).

## Exported records

### `USER_TASK` records

To support [user task listeners](/components/concepts/user-task-listeners.md), some backward incompatible changes were necessary to the exported `USER_TASK` records.

#### `assignee` no longer provided in `CREATED` event

Previously, when a user task was activating with a specified `assignee`,
we appended the following events of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` property as provided

The `ASSIGNING` and `ASSIGNED` events were not appended in this case.

To support the new User Task Listeners feature, the `assignee` value will not be filled in the `CREATED` event anymore.

With 8.8, the following events are now appended:

- `CREATING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `CREATED` with `assignee` always `""` (empty string)
- `ASSIGNING` with `assignee` property as provided
- `ASSIGNED` with `assignee` property as provided

#### `ASSIGNING` has become `CLAIMING` for `CLAIM` operation

When claiming a user task, we previously appended the following records of the `USER_TASK` value type:

- `CLAIM`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

A new `CLAIMING` intent was introduced to distinguish between claiming and regular assigning.
We now append the following records when claiming a user task:

- `CLAIM`
- `CLAIMING`
- `ASSIGNED`

The `ASSIGNING` event is still appended for assigning a user task.
In that case, we append the following records:

- `ASSIGN`
- `ASSIGNING`
- `ASSIGNED`

### Zeebe record types

With the introduction of the Camunda Exporter, the Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Exporter no longer export all record types by default. Therefore, not all `zeebe-record` indices will be populated.

:::note
This only affects records exported with the 8.8 version. During the migration, leftover 8.7 records are exported as normal.
:::

The record types that continue to be exported by default are the following:

- `DEPLOYMENT`
- `PROCESS`
- `PROCESS_INSTANCE`
- `VARIABLE`
- `USER_TASK`
- `INCIDENT`
- `JOB`

To export other record types, review `includeEnabledRecords` for [Elasticsearch](../orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md#configuration) or [OpenSearch](../orchestration-cluster/zeebe/exporters/opensearch-exporter.md#configuration) exporter configuration.

### Exporter deletion

Exporter configuration removal no longer deletes the exporter from the system. Instead, the exporter enters a blocked state to safeguard against data loss caused by accidental or manual configuration changes. To permanently remove an exporter, use the [Exporters API](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/operations/management-api.md).

## Connectors

### Email connector

Starting with the 8.8 release, angle brackets (`<` and `>`) are no longer removed from the `messageId`.

## Logging

### Default configuration

The default logging configuration is included inline for quick reference.  
See the [full logging documentation](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/core-settings/configuration/logging.md) for advanced settings and details.

### Rolling file appender

The `RollingFile` appender is **disabled by default**.  
To enable it, set the appropriate environment variable for each component:

```bash
ZEEBE_LOG_APPENDER=RollingFile
```

Other supported component variables:

- `OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER`
- `IDENTITY_LOG_APPENDER`
- `TASKLIST_LOG_APPENDER`

Make sure to use the correct variable for the component you are configuring.

### Pattern layout changes

The default log pattern has been updated:

**Old pattern:**

```perl
[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}] [%t] %notEmpty{[%X] }%-5level%n\t%logger{36} - %msg%n
```

**New pattern:**

```perl
%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %notEmpty{[%X] }%-5level%logger{1.1.1.*} - %msg%n
```

| Feature             | Old pattern         | New pattern                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Timestamp           | Full date and time  | Time only                          |
| Logger name         | Up to 36 characters | Package initials + full class name |
| Newline after level | Yes                 | No                                 |
| Tab before logger   | Yes                 | No                                 |

## Elasticsearch

Starting in 8.8, the default replica count for Camunda indices in Elasticsearch and OpenSearch changes from 0 to 1.
This ensures that if a node goes down, Camunda is not blocked by a temporary outage of the secondary data store.

If you already override this value, no action is required. Otherwise, review the guidance below to adjust capacity or revert the change.

Throughout this section, references to Elasticsearch (ES) also apply to OpenSearch (OS). For simplicity, ES is used as the default term.

### Single-node cluster

If the current ES cluster has only one node, setting the replica value to 1 will cause the cluster state to go yellow.  
This means all primary shards are allocated, but some replicas are unassigned.

To resolve this issue:

- Increase the number of master-eligible nodes to at least 2.
- Refer to the [Bitnami Elasticsearch Helm chart values](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/elasticsearch/21.6.3), specifically the `master.replicaCount` field.

  ⚠️ **Important:** Bitnami recommends scaling the ES cluster down first for consistency reasons. Follow their guidance carefully.

- See [Elastic Cloud: Resize deployment](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/resize-deployment).

:::note
If you install Elasticsearch using the Camunda Helm chart, the default `master.replicaCount` is `3`, resulting in a three-node cluster.  
For other setups, you can apply the same logic by setting `elasticsearch.master.replicaCount`.
:::

Once complete, continue with [Multi-node cluster](#multi-node-cluster).

### Multi-node cluster

Starting in 8.8, the default replica count for indices is 1. If your cluster previously used a replica count of 0, this will roughly double disk usage.

To ensure the ES cluster can reach a green status, make sure the disk capacity is at least 2.5× the previously used storage.  
This calculation accounts for watermarks, overhead, and growth.

For example:

- In 8.7, node disk usage is 30/50 GB, 35/50 GB, and 40/50 GB.
- The most used node has 40 GB.
- To ensure replicas fit on other nodes, resize all disks to at least 100 GB (40 × 2.5).

#### Resize Elasticsearch disk

If the current disk size is too small for replicas, assign more disk space. Whether a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is expandable depends on the underlying `StorageClass`.

For information on expanding PVCs using the calculations above, see:

- [Kubernetes: Expanding persistent volume claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims)
- [Kubernetes: Storage classes and volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion)

For managed services, see:

- [Elastic Cloud: Fix master nodes out of disk](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/elasticsearch/fix-master-node-out-of-disk)
- [AWS OpenSearch: Modifying an EBS Volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-modify-volume.html)  
  (relevant because AWS OpenSearch is backed by EBS volumes)

### Roll back

If you encounter issues after the upgrade and replica increase, revert the replica count to 0 in the Zeebe deployment and restart.  
Zeebe pods will trigger the processes which update the indices back to 0 replicas.

Set one of the following:

- YAML: `camunda.database.index.numberOfReplicas: 0`
- Env var: `CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEX_NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS=0`

## Web Modeler

### Cluster configuration

#### Removed authentication methods

The previously deprecated authentication methods `OAUTH` and `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` are no longer supported.
If you still use one of them, update the [cluster configuration](/self-managed/components/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#clusters) in your Web Modeler installation:

- Replace `OAUTH` with `BEARER_TOKEN` (the value was just renamed).
- Instead of `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` you can use `BEARER_TOKEN` authentication if the cluster is also on version 8.8 and uses [OIDC authentication](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/identity/connect-external-identity-provider.md) with the same identity provider as Web Modeler.
  The previous limitation that the identity provider must support access tokens with multiple audiences no longer applies.
  However, you need to ensure that the cluster accepts Web Modeler's token audience by [including it in the configured list of audiences](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/identity/connect-external-identity-provider.md#step-4-configure-the-oidc-connection-details).

#### Changed configuration options

The available configuration options now depend on the version of the cluster.
For version 8.8, [new configuration options](/self-managed/components/modeler/web-modeler/configuration/configuration.md#additional-configuration-for-cluster-versions--88) are required.
If your existing configuration contains a cluster that was updated to version 8.8 from a previous version, you need to modify the configuration:

- Change `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_ZEEBE_GRPC` to `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_GRPC`.
- Change `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_ZEEBE_REST` to `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_REST`.
- Add `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_WEBAPP`.
- Add `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_AUTHORIZATIONS_ENABLED`.
- Remove `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_OPERATE`.
- Remove `CAMUNDA_MODELER_CLUSTERS_*_URL_TASKLIST`.
