title: Update 7 to 8
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Elasticsearch 7 to Elasticsearch 8."
---

When updating from Elasticsearch 7 to Elasticsearch 8, follow the [Elasticsearch migration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes.html).

Refer to Camunda 8 [supported environments](reference/supported-environments.md) when updating to ensure compatibility with tested Elasticsearch versions.

More information on specific compatibility issues with Camunda 8 and Elasticsearch 8 can be found below.

## Elasticsearch 8 Curator

Camunda 8 is not compatible with the Elasticsearch 8 Curator. This Curator is used to manage
[data retention](/components/concepts/data-retention.md) within Elasticsearch. To update to Elasticsearch 8,
the Curator must be replaced with
[Index Lifecycle Management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html)
(ILM). Once the update to Elasticsearch 8 is complete, the Curator can be disabled. Disabling the Curator before could
result in indexes without a configured ILM policy. These will not get deleted automatically.

Details on how to configure ILM for Zeebe can be found on the
[Elasticsearch exporter](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter.md#retention) page.

:::tip
The Elasticsearch Curator can be replaced with ILM when using Elasticsearch 7 as well. This is useful when incrementally
updating from Elasticsearch 7 to 8.
