:::note

Camunda 8 Self-Managed is not Camunda 7. If you are looking for Camunda 7 documentation, [click here](https://docs.camunda.org).

However, Optimize documentation is available for both Camunda 8 and Camunda 7, including deployment instructions available [here]($optimize$/self-managed/optimize-deployment/install-and-start). Look for `Camunda 7` badges to help you understand what content is available for what product.

:::

As an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, you can host it yourself; we call this setup Camunda 8 Self-Managed.

Building process automation solutions with Camunda 8 Self-Managed is similar to working with Camunda 8 SaaS. For more information on Camunda 8 SaaS, check out [What is Camunda 8?](../components/concepts/what-is-camunda-8.md) If you are new to Camunda 8, we recommend you start your journey with [Camunda 8 SaaS-based guides](../../guides/).

The content in this section of the documentation will include everything you need to download, configure, and work with each component of Camunda 8 Self-Managed. Features specific to Camunda 8 Self-Managed will be documented in this section.

The following components are available for Camunda 8 Self-Managed:

- Zeebe
- Zeebe Gateway
- Operate
- Tasklist
- Connectors
- Optimize
- Identity (not available in Camunda 8 SaaS)
- Web Modeler [<span class="badge badge--enterprise-only">Enterprise only</span>](../../reference/licenses/#web-modeler)

Camunda 8 Self-Managed users may also use [Desktop Modeler](../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/install-the-modeler) as an addition to these components. Desktop Modeler can be used by process developers to build BPMN diagrams, DMN diagrams, or [Camunda Forms](../guides/utilizing-forms.md) for automation.

While documentation for Optimize is available in the Self-Managed section, we continue to refine the experience for Camunda 8 Self-Managed users.
