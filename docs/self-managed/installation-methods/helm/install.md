import { HelmInstallOverviewMethods } from "@site/src/components/HelmInstallOverviewMethods";

Use this guide to install Camunda 8 Self-Managed with the orchestration cluster, and optionally enable additional components.

<!-- TODO: add links to explain the orchestration cluster and management cluster -->

:::note
By default, the Camunda Helm chart uses Bitnami open-source images. For production environments, Camunda recommends switching to vendor-supported enterprise images. This guide explains how to create registry secrets and install [Camunda with enterprise images](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/configure/registry-and-images/install-bitnami-enterprise-images.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes cluster**: A functioning Kubernetes cluster with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) access and block-storage persistent volumes for stateful components. See [Cloud providers](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/cloud-providers/index.md) for instructions to create a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm**: The Helm CLI installed. See [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Overview

<HelmInstallOverviewMethods/>

## Orchestration Cluster only

1. Create a namespace to install the platform on Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace orchestration
   ```
   output:
   ```bash
   namespace/orchestration created
   ```
2. To install the Camunda 8 Self-Managed [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), add the [Helm repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/) with the following command:
   ```bash
   helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
   helm repo update
   ```
3. Install the Helm chart on your namespace:
   ```bash
   helm install camunda camunda/camunda-platform -n orchestration
   ```
4. [Access the components](#access-the-components)

### Install a specific version (optional)

By default, the Camunda Helm chart installs the latest version of the [Camunda 8 applications](/reference/supported-environments.md). Because Helm chart and application versions are released independently, their version numbers differ. For details, see the [Camunda 8 Helm Chart Version Matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix/).

To install the latest version of the chart and its application dependencies, run:

```shell
helm install camunda camunda/camunda-platform --version $HELM_CHART_VERSION \
    --values https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/values/values-latest.yaml
```

To install a specific chart version, use the `--version` flag with the chart version number. For example, the chart version for Camunda 8.8 is `13`:

```shell
helm install camunda camunda/camunda-platform --version 13 \
    --values https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/values/values-v8.8.yaml
```

Specifying only the major chart version (for example, `13`) installs the latest available `13.x.y` release. You can also specify a minor version (for example, `12.6`) to install the latest `12.6.y` release.

If you are unsure which chart version corresponds to your Camunda application version, run:

```shell
helm search repo -l camunda/camunda-platform
```

This command lists all available chart versions and their corresponding application versions.

## Full Cluster

<!-- TODO: Add links to doc pages that explain each component. -->

The following components run outside the orchestration cluster and are disable by default in Helm Charts:

- Optimize
- Web Modeler
- Console
- Management Identity
- Keycloak

These components do not support basic authentication, so you must use any OIDC provider. In the following example, we use Keycloak as a locally running OIDC provider. The values file will deploy all Camunda 8 components.

<!-- TODO: Add a suitable link to explain what a values.yaml file is. -->

Because the default configuration of the Helm chart uses basic authentication, you need to create a [values.yaml](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) file to modify the default configuration to:

- Enable Keycloak to provide another method of authentication via OIDC.
- Enable other Camunda components that run alongside the orchestration cluster.

<!-- TODO: Remove setting existingSecret in favor of autoGenerate secrets -->

Create a file called `camunda-values.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  secrets:
    autoGenerated: true
    name: "camunda-credentials"
  identity:
    auth:
      enabled: true
      publicIssuerUrl: "http://localhost:18080/auth/realms/camunda-platform"
      webModeler:
        redirectUrl: "http://localhost:8070"
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
      console:
        redirectUrl: "http://localhost:8087"
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"
      optimize:
        redirectUrl: "http://localhost:8083"
        secret:
          existingSecret: "camunda-credentials"

Installing all components in a cluster requires downloading all related Docker images to the Kubernetes nodes. The time required depends on your cloud provider and network speed.

For more information about enabling other components, see [Enable Web Modeler, Console, and Connectors](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/configure/web-modeler-console-connectors.md).

<!-- TODO: Add a section about port-forward. Currently, port-forward is not working because the redirect URIs are configured with the Kubernetes service names. If the redirect URIs are set to localhost, the orchestration cluster will be unhealthy since it cannot access Keycloak through localhost. -->

## Access the components

Run the following command to locally port-forward the orchestration cluster pod to access the UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-zeebe-gateway 8080:8080
```

Use the following URLs to access the orchestration cluster UIs:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/identity
http://localhost:8080/operate
http://localhost:8080/tasklist
```

By default, the Helm chart deploys the Camunda orchestration cluster with **basic authentication**, intended only for testing and development. In production, Camunda 8 is typically deployed together with additional applications such as Optimize, Web Modeler, and Console, which require **OIDC-based authentication** (for example, using Keycloak). For details, see the [Full Cluster](#full-cluster) section.

For basic authentication use the default credentials:

```
username: demo
password: demo
```

## Troubleshoot installation issues

Verify that each pod is running and ready. If a pod is pending, it cannot be scheduled onto a node. This usually happens when the cluster does not have enough resources. To check messages from the scheduler, run:

```shell
kubectl describe pods <POD_NAME>
```

If the `describe` output does not help, check the pod logs by running:

```shell
kubectl logs -f <POD_NAME>
```

## Notes and requirements

- **Zeebe** supports Kubernetes startup and liveness probes. See [Gateway health probes](/self-managed/components/orchestration-cluster/zeebe/configuration/gateway-health-probes.md).
- **Zeebe** must be deployed as a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) to preserve cluster node identities. StatefulSets require persistent storage, which you must provision in advance. The type of storage depends on your cloud provider.
- **Docker pull limits** apply when downloading Camunda 8 images from Docker Hub. To avoid disruptions, authenticate with Docker Hub or use a mirror registry.
- **Air-gapped environments** require additional configuration. See [Helm chart air-gapped environment installation](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/configure/registry-and-images/air-gapped-installation.md).
- **Image sources**: By default, the Helm chart uses Bitnami open-source images for infrastructure dependencies (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Keycloak). For production environments, Camunda recommends using Bitnami Premium images for enhanced security and vendor support. For detailed information about image types, CVE handling policies, and installation procedures, see [Install Bitnami enterprise images](/self-managed/installation-methods/helm/configure/registry-and-images/install-bitnami-enterprise-images.md).
