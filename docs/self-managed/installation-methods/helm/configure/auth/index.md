In this document we will explore the various methods to authenticate and authorize your users on the Camunda 8 Self-Managed Helm chart.

1. Basic auth.
2. OIDC.
3. Authorization code flow (with OIDC enabled on the orchestration cluster)

## Prerequisites

Outline any downloads, installations, particular versions, etc., that the user may need before getting started. Do they need to create a Camunda 8 account? Should they have Java or Node.js installed?

## Set up

Does the user need to clone a repository? Do they need to log in to a Camunda 8 account?

## Action steps

This section can be separated into multiple H3 subsections if necessary. Optimally, this is where you introduce the user to the actual action steps (preferably numerical) or directions.

## Additional resources

Are there additional resources or reference material the user could benefit from?

## Next steps

Where could the user go next/what could the user read next to further their knowledge or experience with the subject?
