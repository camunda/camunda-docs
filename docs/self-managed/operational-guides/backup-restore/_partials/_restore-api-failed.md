If a single partition fails to restore, for example because its backup is corrupted or the backup store is temporarily unreachable, the partial data of that partition is dropped and the failed step is retried automatically with a backoff. The restore change stays pending, and the restore status keeps reporting the partition as `RESTORING`.

Because the retry is automatic, first try to fix the root cause instead of sending a new restore request. Once the cause is resolved, the pending change continues on its own and completes.
