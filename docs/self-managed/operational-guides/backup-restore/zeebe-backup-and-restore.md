keywords: ["backup", "backups"]
---

A backup of a Zeebe cluster is comprised of a consistent snapshot of all partitions. The backup is taken asynchronously in the background while Zeebe is processing. Thus, the backups can be taken with minimal impact on typical processing. The backups can be used to restore a cluster in case of failures that lead to full data loss or data corruption.

Zeebe provides a REST API to create backups, query, and manage existing backups.
The backup management API is a custom endpoint `backups`, available via [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.7.x/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.endpoints). This is accessible via the management port of the gateway. The API documentation is also available as [OpenApi specification](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/main/dist/src/main/resources/api/backup-management-api.yaml).

## Configuration

To use the backup feature in Zeebe, you must choose which external storage system you will use.
Make sure to set the same configuration on all brokers in your cluster.

Zeebe supports [S3](#s3-backup-store), [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](#gcs-backup-store), and [Azure](#azure-backup-store) for external storage.

:::caution
Backups created with one store are not available or restorable from another store.

This is especially relevant if you were using GCS through the S3 compatibility mode and want to switch to the new built-in support for GCS now.
Even when the underlying storage bucket is the same, backups from one are not compatible with the other.
:::

### S3 backup store

To store your backups in any S3 compatible storage system such as [AWS S3] or [MinIO], set the backup store to `S3` and tell Zeebe how to connect to your bucket. This configuration can be set in your Zeebe [`config/application.yaml`](/docs/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/configuration.md):

```yaml
zeebe:
  broker:
    data:
      backup:
        store: S3
        s3:
          bucketName:
          basePath:
          region:
          endpoint:
          accessKey:
          secretKey:
```

Alternatively, you can configure backup store using environment variables:

- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_STORE` - Set this to `S3` to store backups in S3 buckets.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_BUCKETNAME` - The backup is stored in this bucket. **The bucket must already exist**.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_BASEPATH` - If the bucket is shared with other Zeebe clusters, a unique basePath must be configured.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT` - If no endpoint is provided, it is determined based on the configured region.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_REGION` - If no region is provided, it is determined [from the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/region-selection.html#automatically-determine-the-aws-region-from-the-environment).
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_ACCESSKEY` - If either `accessKey` or `secretKey` is not provided, the credentials are determined [from the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain).
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_SECRETKEY` - Specify the secret key.

#### Backup Encryption

Zeebe does not support backup encryption natively, but it _can_ use encrypted S3 buckets. For AWS S3, this means [enabling default bucket encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/default-bucket-encryption.html).

Using default bucket encryption gives you control over the encryption keys and algorithms while being completely transparent with Zeebe.

Combined with TLS between Zeebe and the S3 API, backups are fully encrypted in transit and at rest. Other S3 compatible services might have similar features that should work as well.

#### Backup compression

Backups can be large depending on your usage of Zeebe. To reduce S3 storage costs and upload times, you can enable backup compression.

Zeebe compresses backup data immediately before uploading to S3 and buffers the compressed files in a temporary directory. Compression and buffering of compressed files can have a negative effect if Zeebe is heavily resource constrained.

You can enable compression by specifying a compression algorithm to use. We recommend using [zstd] as it provides a good trade off between compression ratio and resource usage.

More compression algorithms are available; check [commons-compress] for a full list.

```yaml
zeebe.broker.data.backup.s3.compression: zstd # or use environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_S3_COMPRESSION
```

[zstd]: https://github.com/facebook/zstd
[commons-compress]: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/

### GCS backup store

:::note
The GCS backup strategy utilizes the [Google Cloud Storage REST API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints).
:::

To store your backups in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), choose the `GCS` backup store and tell Zeebe which bucket to use. This configuration can be set in your Zeebe [`config/application.yaml`](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/configuration.md):

```yaml
zeebe:
  broker:
    data:
      backup:
        store: GCS
        gcs:
          bucketName: # or use environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_GCS_BUCKETNAME
          basePath: # or use environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_GCS_BASEPATH
```

The bucket specified with `bucketName` **must already exist**, Zeebe will not try to create one for you.
To prevent misconfiguration, Zeebe will check at startup that the specified bucket exists and can be accessed, and log at WARN level if the bucket does not exist.

Setting a `basePath` is not required but useful if you want to use the same bucket for multiple Zeebe clusters.
When `basePath` is set, Zeebe will only create and access objects under this path.
This can be any string that is a valid [object name](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/objects#naming), for example the name of your cluster.

Authentication is handled by [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials).
In many cases, these credentials are automatically provided by the runtime environment.
If you need more control, you can customize authentication by [setting environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC) `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

#### Backup encryption

There are multiple [data encryption options](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption), some of which are supported by Zeebe:

- [Default server-side encryption](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/default-keys) is fully supported.
  This is enabled by default for all GCS buckets.
- [Customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys) are supported if they are [set as
  the default key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/using-customer-managed-keys#set-default-key) for your bucket.
- [Customer-supplied encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-supplied-keys) are not supported.
- [Client-side encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/client-side-keys) are not supported.

### Azure backup store

To store your backups in Azure Storage, choose the `AZURE` backup store and specify how to connect with the Azure container. This configuration can be set in your Zeebe [`config/application.yaml`](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/configuration/configuration.md):

```yaml
zeebe:
  broker:
    data:
      backup:
        store: AZURE
        azure:
          endpoint:
          accountName:
          accountKey:
          connectionString:
          basePath:
```

Alternatively, you can configure backup store using environment variables:

- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_STORE` - Set this to `AZURE` to store backups in Azure buckets.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_AZURE_ENDPOINT` - Name of the endpoint where the backup will be stored.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_AZURE_ACCOUNTNAME` - The account name that is used to connect to the service.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY` - The account key that is used to connect to the service.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_AZURE_CONNECTIONSTRING` - The [connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) to connect to the service. If this is defined, it will override the account name, account key, and endpoint.
- `ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_BACKUP_AZURE_BASEPATH` - The base path is used to define the container name where the blobs will be saved. This value must not be empty. When `basePath` is set, Zeebe will only create and access objects under this path.
  This can be any string that is a valid [container name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names), for example the name of your cluster.

#### Backup encryption

- [Default server-side encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#about-azure-storage-service-side-encryption) is fully supported, is enabled by default, and can't be switched off.
- [Customer-managed encryption keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) are supported if they are configured in the Azure store.
- [Customer-provided encryption keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/encryption-customer-provided-keys) are not supported.
- [Client-side encryption keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/client-side-encryption?tabs=dotnet) are not supported.

## Create backup API

The following request can be used to start a backup.

### Request

```
POST actuator/backups
{
  "backupId": <backupId>
}
```

A `backupId` is an integer and must be greater than the ID of previous backups that are completed, failed, or deleted.
Zeebe does not take two backups with the same ids. If a backup fails, a new `backupId` must be provided to trigger a new backup.
The `backupId` cannot be reused, even if the backup corresponding to the backup ID is deleted.

## Restore

A new Zeebe cluster can be created from a specific backup. Camunda provides a standalone app which must be run on each node where a Zeebe broker will be running. This is a Spring Boot application similar to the broker and can run using the binary provided as part of the distribution. The app can be configured the same way a broker is configured - via environment variables or using the configuration file located in `config/application.yaml`.

To restore a Zeebe cluster, run the following in each node where the broker will be running:

```
tar -xzf zeebe-distribution-X.Y.Z.tar.gz -C zeebe/
./bin/restore --backupId=<backupId>
```

If restore was successful, the app exits with a log message of `Successfully restored broker from backup`.

Restore fails if:

- There is no valid backup with the given backupId.
- Backup store is not configured correctly.
- The configured data directory is not empty.
- Any other unexpected errors.

If the restore fails, you can re-run the application after fixing the root cause.

:::note
When restoring, provide the same configuration (node id, data directory, cluster size, and replication count) as the broker that will be running in this node. The partition count must be same as in the backup.
:::
