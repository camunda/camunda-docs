title: Update 8.4 to 8.5
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.4.x to Camunda 8.5.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.4.x to 8.5.x for each component.

## Helm chart

:::caution Breaking Changes
The Camunda Helm chart v10.0.0 that comes with Camunda 8.5 has major change in the values file stracture. Ensure to update the values keys before starting the chart upgrade.
:::

Carefully follow the [upgrade instractions](../../platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/upgrade.md#v1000) to upgrade from Camunda Helm chart v9.x.x to Camunda Helm chart v10.x.x.

## Zeebe

### Deprecated broker health checks

The broker health check routes have moved, and the old routes are now deprecated. Specifically, the following routes will return [a status code of 301](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301) and redirect you. See the table below about the new mappings:

| Old route                               | **New route**                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/health  | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/status**    |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/ready   | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/readiness** |
| http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/startup | **http://{zeebe-broker-host}:9600/actuator/health/startup**   |

Please migrate to the new routes in your deployments. **If you're using the official Helm charts, then you don't have to do anything here.**

### Changes to exported records

The `UserTask` events like `UserTask:CREATED` don't export the string value properties `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` anymore.
As a replacement, user task events now feature the string array properties `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList`.
Custom exporters using these events must be modified accordingly.

:::warning Breaking Change
The values of the `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` properties in user task records are lost during an update from `8.4` to `8.5`.
There is no data migration that moves the values from `candidateUsers` and `candidateGroups` to `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList`
since the Zeebe user tasks are only experimental in `8.4`.

If you need the data on migrated user task instances, you can reactivate them using [Process Instance Modification](/components/concepts/process-instance-modification.md).
This results in a `UserTask:CANCELED` event for the existing user task and a new `UserTask:CREATED` event with the `candidateUsersList` and `candidateGroupsList` filled based on what is configured in the process model.
