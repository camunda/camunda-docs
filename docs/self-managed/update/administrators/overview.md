# Overview of an upgrade to Camunda 8.8

Updating a Self-Managed Camunda 8 installation requires both preparation and execution steps.  
This section provides a single entry point for administrators, linking to the two core guides:

- **Prepare for an upgrade** – how to assess readiness and plan your upgrade.
- **Run the upgrade** – how to execute the upgrade safely and verify results.

## When to use this section

Use these guides if you:

- Maintain the infrastructure running Camunda 8.
- Need to upgrade from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x (direct updates from earlier versions are not supported).
- Want to understand both pre-update planning and the technical steps for the upgrade.
