Enterprise customers can flexibly resize their clusters to adjust capacity and performance.

- Increase or decrease the cluster size at any time by adding or removing hosting packages.
- For example, increase the cluster size to improve performance and add capacity, or decrease the cluster size to free up reservations for another cluster.

To learn more about this feature, see [resize a cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-cluster.md#resize-a-cluster).

#### Deployment stages

Predefined deployment stages for process applications are now also available in Web Modeler Self-Managed.

- Select your dev, test, stage, and prod clusters to ensure process applications flow easily and predictably through your deployment pipeline.
- For added control, do not assign a stage or prod environment to enable rapid iteration in Web Modeler while still ensuring deployments run through your approved pipeline.

#### Simplified deployment

The deployment experience for Enterprise customers running Web Modeler Self-Managed is simplified.

- During Camunda installation, you can configure your Helm chart to decide which clusters are available from Web Modeler by default, and save their connection information.
- With this setup, you only need to select a cluster, and add secrets and a tenant ID as required.
