| 8 October 2024 | 14 April 2026      | - [ Camunda 8 core ](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/releases/tag/8.6.0) <br /> - [ Connectors ](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/releases/tag/8.6.0) | [Release blog](https://camunda.com/blog/2024/10/camunda-8-6-release/) | [Self-Managed update guide](self-managed/operational-guides/update-guide/850-to-860.md) |

### Flow control enabled by default <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span>

Flow control is now enabled by default in Camunda 8.6 SaaS. This change ensures the cluster is protected from excessive load and can maintain a stable state.

These new configuration defaults are tailored to the cluster size and optimized for a stable performance. However, the cluster might reject requests if the load is too high with this change. The error message for this is `Failed to write client request to partition X, because the write limit is exhausted`. If the error persists, this may be a sign of underlining issues, or a need to adjust the cluster size.

For more information on how to configure flow control for a Self-Managed cluster, visit the [flow control documentation](/self-managed/operational-guides/configure-flow-control/configure-flow-control.md).

### Support for Amazon OpenSearch for Optimize

This release extends the OpenSearch features supported by Optimize. Full support is committed for the 8.8 release.

### Spring Zeebe SDK test support in 8.6.7

[Testing support for the Spring Zeebe SDK](/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started.md#writing-test-cases) is available in the 8.6.7 release.

:::note
This closes the feature gap where the Spring Zeebe SDK released with Camunda 8.5.0 did not offer the testing support previously available in the [Spring Zeebe Community Project](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe/blob/main/README.md#writing-test-cases).
:::

### Advanced SaaS offering <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span> <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2377 -->

Enterprise customers can now choose to use our advanced SaaS offering for automation clusters. This increases uptime guarantees to 99.9% and reduces RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) to under one hour for single-region outages.

When [creating a cluster](/components/console/manage-clusters/create-cluster.md) in SaaS, you can now choose the cluster type and size to meet your organization's availability and scalability needs, and to provide control over cluster performance, uptime, and disaster recovery guarantees.

- Cluster type: Defines the level of availability and uptime for the cluster. Choose from basic, Standard, or Advanced.
- Cluster size: Defines the cluster performance and capacity. Choose from four cluster sizes: 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x.

To learn more about this feature, see [clusters](/components/concepts/clusters.md).

:::note

- To learn more about migrating your existing clusters to the newer model, contact your Customer Success Manager.
- Prior to 8.6, clusters were configured by hardware size (S, M, L).

:::

### Automatically onboard organization users via external IDP login<span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2385 -->

Default organizations for an external identity provider are available for organizations on an Enterprise plan.

- When setting up an external identity provider, you can configure up to 10 default organizations.
- A user logging in with the configured connection is automatically assigned to these organizations with the corresponding role.

:::note

You must add the following information into the ticket for the support team to configure the default organizations:

- Organization Id
- Default organization roles

:::

### Business Knowledge Models (BKM) in DMN <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Modeler">Modeler</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1858 -->

Business Knowledge Models (BKM) can now be implemented in a decision model.

- Users can extract and reuse expressions in their DMN diagrams.
- When writing an expression in a decision, the BKM name autocompletes together with the required parameters.

:::note
Viewing a BKM in Operate is not supported yet.
:::

### Deprecate zbctl and GO client <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2438 -->

The Go and zbctl clients are moved to the [Camunda Community Hub](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub) following the introduction of the Camunda 8 REST API for Process Management.

- These clients are no longer officially supported by Camunda, as [announced on our blog](https://camunda.com/blog/2024/09/deprecating-zbctl-and-go-clients/).
- Use the Camunda 8 REST API for easier interaction with the Zeebe engine, and work with it in the same way as any other REST service.
- Use the OpenAPI definition, the supported Postman collection, or cURL to get started implementing API requests in your code. We also recommend trying the new clients and SDKs.

:::

### Email connector <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects connectors">Connectors</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2430 -->

The new Email connector allows you to integrate your BPMN service with any email server using POP3, IMAP, or SMTP. You can use this connector to automate the retrieval, deletion, search, and organization of emails directly within your processes.

### Encryption at rest <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span> <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues/801 -->

You can now use advanced encryption key mechanisms on Camunda 8 SaaS when creating new clusters.

- By default, Camunda 8 SaaS cluster data at rest is protected with a provider-managed encryption key using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) encryption. The encryption key is owned and managed by GCP.
- Enterprise customers requiring a higher level of protection can select a dedicated Camunda-managed software or hardware (HSM) encryption key when creating a new cluster. The encryption key is managed by Camunda using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
- You can configure encryption keys on a per-cluster basis so that each cluster has a dedicated encryption key.

To learn more about this feature, see [encryption at rest](/components/concepts/encryption-at-rest.md).

### Execution listener support<span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2102 -->

Execution listeners are introduced, allowing you to respond to transitions within a process instance effectively, such as when needing to add pre- and post-processing logic for specific elements in the process definition without bloating the diagram.

- You can add execution listeners to any activity, including process instances.
- Developers can use the existing job worker concept to efficiently handle listener jobs, passing additional variables as needed and using typical job properties such as retries or job type.

### Investigate and resolve incidents with execution listeners <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Operate">Operate</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2103 -->

You can now easily check details of active and completed execution listeners for process activities and process instances.

- Operations engineers can efficiently resolve execution listener incidents.
- This enhancement streamlines operations and ensures smoother handling of incidents, ultimately improving time taken to unblock process execution.

### Play Camunda Cluster Integration <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Play">Play</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1029 -->

The Play architecture now uses your own Camunda cluster (running 8.6 or higher).

You can now develop and test any process in the Modeler, and Play processes at all maturity stages, from early prototypes with mocks to live UI demos.

- Use your existing infrastructure, API clients, secrets, and cluster applications such as Operate and Tasklist.
- Architects benefit from a streamlined architecture and secure environment, and developers benefit from BPMN and feature parity with their production environment and the ability to debug the integration with their custom applications.

:::note
With this change, the alpha Play infrastructure hosted in our SaaS environment is deprecated. SaaS users will see this change immediately. Self-Managed users running Web Modeler versions 8.5 or below will lose Play access after the January 8.7 release.
:::

### Process management endpoints migrated to Camunda 8 REST API <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2040 -->

Zeebe endpoints are integrated into the Camunda 8 REST API to make building process applications easier.

- Installation and onboarding to Camunda 8 is improved as gRPC is no longer required. Introducing Zeebe endpoints in the Camunda 8 REST API eliminates the need for gRPC, making adoption easier than ever.
- Developers can now seamlessly transition from gRPC to REST with the assurance of using the same endpoints.
- For easy migration use the officially supported Camunda SDKs.

### Version Migration: Auto-mapping for process activities during migration <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Operate">Operate</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1831 -->

Auto-mapping simplifies the process of migrating complex and lengthy process definitions.

- Operations engineers can quickly map source activities to their corresponding target activities, reducing manual effort and making it easier to focus on changes.
- Users can manually add mapping instructions for new activities and track migration details directly within the instance.

| 10 September 2024 | - [ Camunda 8 core ](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha5) <br /> - [ Connectors ](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/releases/tag/8.6.0-alpha5) | [Release blog](https://camunda.com/blog/2024/09/camunda-alpha-release-september-2024/) |

### Auto-pause <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects SaaS">SaaS</span> <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Console">Console</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2419 -->

`dev` tagged clusters on free plans now automatically pause after 8 hours to conserve resources.

- No data is lost, although it takes a few minutes to restart them in Modeler or Console.
- To avoid auto-pausing, add a `test`, `stage`, or `prod` tag to your cluster, or [upgrade to a Starter or Enterprise plan](https://camunda.com/pricing/).

This change allows Camunda to continue to offer dedicated, private clusters to our trial users.

### Customize Tasklist user interface in Self-Managed <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Self-Managed">Self-Managed</span> <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Tasklist">Tasklist</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2177 -->

### Internationalization (I18n) for Tasklist <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Tasklist">Tasklist</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2378 -->

When creating a process for a local (non-English) region, you can design forms in the local language and have the Tasklist interface in the same language.

- By default, Tasklist supports four languages: English, French, German, and Spanish.
- The interface language is automatically determined by the user device's language settings.
- The interface defaults to English if the device's language is not supported.

### Message correlation with result <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1818 -->

The Camunda 8 REST API provides an [endpoint for synchronous message correlation](/apis-tools/orchestration-cluster-api-rest/specifications/correlate-message.api.mdx), enabling external systems to immediately determine the success or failure of message correlation. This enhancement allows external systems to take prompt and appropriate actions based on the correlation result, improving overall efficiency and reducing response times.

### Public Marketplace blueprint support for HTO & DMN <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Web Modeler">Web Modeler</span> <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Marketplace">Marketplace</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2333 -->

Web Modeler now supports DMN models and Forms inside [Marketplace blueprints](https://marketplace.camunda.com/en-US/listing?pl=3082&cat=107793&locale=en-US).

- These blueprints can now showcase even more ways to implement common business processes, and illustrate best practices for process modeling and implementation.
- To learn more about browsing Marketplace blueprints, see [browse marketplace blueprints](/components/modeler/web-modeler/camunda-marketplace.md#browse-marketplace-blueprints).

### User Task priority field <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/217 -->

Organizations often face challenges in ensuring that teams focus on the most important tasks within complex workflows. To address this, the task priority feature allows you to define and manage task priorities within a BPMN process, ensuring that important assignments receive the attention they deserve.

- User Task priority is an integer value that determines the importance of a task within a workflow.
- The supported priority values range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50. A higher priority value indicates higher importance.

### Version tag binding for linked resources support <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Modeler">Modeler</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/435 -->

You can now pin dependent files using a user-generated version tag. By specifying a version tag like "1.3.4", you can ensure that the right version of a dependent BPMN, DMN, or Form file is always used, regardless of future deployments. This feature is ideal for managing external or shared dependencies.

### Write rate limiting based on exporting rate <span class="badge badge--long" title="This feature affects Zeebe">Zeebe</span>

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1426 -->

A new Zeebe unified flow control mechanism can limit user commands and rate limit writes of new records in general. By default, Zeebe tries to achieve 200ms response times for user commands. You can use this new feature to prevent the buildup of an excessive exporting backlog.

To limit the write rate, you can either set a static limit or enable throttling that dynamically adjusts the write rate based on the exporting backlog and rate.
If activated, you might see more backpressure in cases where exporters are not exporting fast enough, so that a backlog builds up. The backpressure error message contains information to explain what is happening, and you can also refer to the documentation to understand what to do in such cases.

- SaaS: The new write limit is automatically applied to Saas default hosting packages.
- Self-Managed: Limiting is disabled by default. If required, you can
  activate and tune the write limit. See the [operational guide](/self-managed/operational-guides/configure-flow-control/configure-flow-control.md) for more
  information.
