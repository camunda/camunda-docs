Camunda collects a variety of telemetry data to evaluate contractual usage, provide a better user experience, and improve its products. This section describes which telemetry data is collected, how Camunda ensures privacy, and what options you have to modify which telemetry data is sent to Camunda. This document is designed to help you understand what telemetry data includes and excludes, applies only to interactions with Camunda's products, and will be updated periodically.

## Purposes

Camunda collects certain types of data we call “telemetry data” for the purposes described below:

- Billing
- Improving the user experience by tracking and analyzing usage of the software
- Ensuring the security, stability, and functionality of the foftware
- Providing support and guidance to customers to help optimize product usage and new functionalities.

## Principles

Camunda follows certain principles in its collection and use of telemetry data to ensure the privacy of its customers and the success of its product development efforts:

- Camunda will use telemetry data subject to applicable law (including opt-in and opt-out functionalities for personal data where necessary).
  Telemetry data is generally aggregated unless users opt-in for personalized use of their telemetry data (for example, to provide additional support or optimize product usage to customers).
- Telemetry data does not include any data shared in process instances or uploaded in customer clusters. Therefore, **no end-user or end-customer personal data**, personal information (PII), or protected health information (PHI) uploaded to a customer cluster is part of telemetry data.
- Telemetry data does **not include payment information**.
- Camunda does **not sell any personal (user) information.**
- **For Self-Managed customers, telemetry data is always fully anonymous and only sent upon admin/owner enablement from the customer.**
- Data collected from end-users such as form fills or process variables are not part of telemetry data. For example, if part of your process involves a user filling in a shipping address, that address is not telemetry data.
- Assets like the BPMN diagram describing how a process is defined and executed are not telemetry data. Telemetry data does not include information about how customers develop their processes, like keystrokes or BPMN diagrams. Instead, it includes user-provided identifiers like a process ID to track which Camunda software features are used when developing a process.
- Customers are responsible for avoiding sharing intellectual property, personal data or sensitive data through interaction with AI features. The data collected by different AI features is shared [below](#usage-telemetry-data-saas-and-desktop-modeler-only).
- Camunda will not use telemetry data in any way that identifies the source of the telemetry data to third parties except as necessary for Camunda to enforce its rights and contractual obligations, such as charging fees for overage of usage metrics or complying with a lawful subpoena.

## Telemetry data collection

Telemetry data includes contractual metrics, environment, and usage data. Telemetry data is collected automatically in SaaS (except for personalized telemetry data which is only used via user discretionary opt-in) and collected via admin discretionary opt-in for Self-Managed platforms. Each category of telemetry data is described below.

### Contractual metrics telemetry data

Contractual metrics telemetry data includes a limited set of contractually agreed [usage metrics](/reference/data-collection/usage-metrics.md) to evaluate usage metric use and bill for overages. One example is how many process instance usage metrics are used compared to the number of process instance usage metrics purchased by customers. These are summary usage metrics that contain no sensitive information and that are collected automatically for SaaS customers and sent in a report generated by Self-Managed customers.

### Environment telemetry data (Self-Managed only)

Environment telemetry data includes information about your Self-Managed installations to enable better support and product improvement decisions. Self-Managed customers may choose to send a very limited set of environment information through the Console component's telemetry mechanism. View the [telemetry](/self-managed/console-deployment/telemetry.md) page for a description of this data. Environment telemetry data is not relevant to SaaS installations.

### Usage telemetry data (SaaS and Desktop Modeler only)

Usage telemetry data includes limited product usage data to help make better product improvement decisions and enable outreach to support users. This section describes the types of data and how they are collected.

- Feature Usage:

  - SaaS System Actions: All SaaS organizations submit basic information about which features are being used as part of telemetry data collection. When certain features are used, Camunda logs which feature is used and basic information about how it has been used. This information is tied to a pseudonymized organization.
  - SaaS User Actions: Users that opt-in to personalization cookies gain access to in-app tutorials, whereas analytics cookies cause data to be automatically submitted about which features they interact with in Camunda’s UI as part of telemetry data. In addition to the data collected from system actions described above, Camunda collects cursor activity, geographical area, browser information, and basic biographical information limited to email, name, and city/region/country for user actions. If a user interacts through API, then personal information is not collected.

  <img src={AnalyticsImg} alt="Analytics opt-in menu" width="500px" style={{border: 'none', padding: '0', marginTop: '0', backgroundColor: 'transparent'}}/>

  - Desktop Modeler User Actions: Users opting into collection of telemetry data in [Desktop Modeler](/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/telemetry/telemetry.md) send data to Camunda to track how certain features are used, as described in the linked document.

- AI Usage: Camunda's AI features, currently available in SaaS only, are clearly labeled as AI features. For Enterprise organizations, these features must be enabled by the customer via opt-in in the [Console](/components/console/manage-organization/enable-alpha-features.md#enable-ai-powered-features). Depending on the feature, they may collect different information.
  - Camunda [Docs AI](/components/modeler/web-modeler/advanced-modeling/camunda-docs-ai.md) records the entire conversation to provide ongoing support.
  - Camunda [Copilots](/components/early-access/alpha/bpmn-copilot/bpmn-copilot.md) only gather usage telemetry data. Camunda automatically logs all information sent to and from our AI models for system monitoring by a limited set of operators. Camunda will only use the data from free users for product and model improvement.
