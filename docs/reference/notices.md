## Notice 33

### Publication date

October 22nd, 2025

### Products affected

- Orchestration Cluster

### Impact

There was a bug in the signal broadcast command processing which allowed users to trigger either signal start events, or signal intermediate catch events, in certain process definitions without being authorized to create or update the process definitions.

This **did not** allow users to access process definitions of other tenants, or leak any information about these process instances back to the unauthorized users.

### How to determine if the installation is affected

You are using:

- Orchestration Cluster 8.8.0

### Solution

Camunda has provided the following release which contains the fix:

- Orchestration Cluster 8.8.1

a flaw where malformed client requests can trigger server-side stream resets without incrementing abuse counters.
This issue, referred to as the "MadeYouReset" attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive server workload by
repeatedly causing server-side stream aborts and could be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).

### How to determine if the installation is affected

You are using:

- Web Modeler Self-Managed 8.8.0, ≤ 8.7.10, or ≤ 8.6.19

### Solution

smuggling vulnerability in Netty. Incorrect parsing of chunked transfer encoding could allow attackers to craft
malicious requests that are interpreted inconsistently by proxies and Netty.

### How to determine if the installation is affected

You are using:

- Tasklist 8.7.0 - 8.7.12 or 8.5.0 - 8.5.22

## Notice 29

### Publication date

October 3, 2025

### Products affected

- Camunda Zeebe

### Impact

Zeebe may be affected by [CVE-2024-41996](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41996), which allows remote attackers to trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, potentially causing asymmetric resource consumption and DoS attacks.

### How to determine if the installation is affected

You are potentially affected if you have configured Zeebe to accept DHE or ECDHE cipher suites through the `server.ssl.ciphers` property or `SERVER_SSL_CIPHERS` environment variable.

Default Zeebe installations are not affected.

### Solution

Configure the `server.ssl.ciphers` property or `SERVER_SSL_CIPHERS` environment variable to exclude DHE and ECDHE cipher suites. For example:

```
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
```

There is no known mitigation other than disabling the use of DHE and ECDHE cipher suites.

## Notice 17

### Publication date

April 8, 2025

### Products affected

Camunda Zeebe

### Impact

When parsing unknown fields in the Protobuf Java Lite and Full library, a maliciously crafted message can cause a StackOverflow error and lead to a
program crash.

- As Zeebe makes extensive use of Protobuf, this could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) issues on the server side.
- This issue allows an attacker to send specific payloads that will always result in `StackOverflowException`. This could lead to gateway performance issues and affect system availability.
- Although the gateway will not crash, it will spend more time working on these requests. An attacker could use this opportunity to slow it down and make it unusable by sending a large number of requests within a short time frame.

No data is leaked, lost, or corrupted. This issue only affects application availability.
