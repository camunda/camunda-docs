## Enhancements

## 8.6.0-alpha1

### PDLC blueprint

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/2014 -->

Developing and releasing Camunda processes in compliance with your organization's policies often creates a long-running, sometimes complex process across many endpoints - a great use case for an orchestrator like Camunda. Camunda is taking the first steps to orchestrate the development lifecycle using its own engine, relevant connectors, and a [customizable blueprint](https://marketplace.camunda.com/en-US/apps/439170/cicd-pipeline) that you can modify to fit your needs.

### Process Application MVP (SaaS only)

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1983 -->

The [process application](/components/modeler/web-modeler/process-applications.md) is a special type of folder in Web Modeler that enable bulk actions like deploying all assets together. This reduces the risk of having a broken deployment at runtime and makes it more convenient to deploy related files.

### Instance modification as batch

<!-- Link to main page in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3747 -->

With the new release operating mass incidents is easier with [batch instance modification](/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-batch-modification.md). If there was an issue in process execution that caused you to enter the wrong process branch or data was corrupted, you can select multiple process instances and move them to the correct place in the process.

### Relative dates in task tiles

<!-- No docs available -->

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Anti CSRF token for Tasklist

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3672 -->

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an [anti CSRF token](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).
