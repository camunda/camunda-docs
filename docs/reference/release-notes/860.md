## Enhancements

## 8.6.0-alpha1

### Instance modification as batch

<!-- Link to main page in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3747 -->

With the new release operating mass incidents is easier with [batch instance modification](/components/operate/userguide/process-instance-batch-modification.md). If there was an issue in process execution that caused you to enter the wrong process branch or data was corrupted, you can select multiple process instances and move them to the correct place in the process.

### Relative dates in task tiles

<!-- No docs available -->

Creation, due, and follow-up dates are now shown as relative dates in task tiles (e.g. "Tomorrow" instead of "10 April 2024 - 13:34 PM").

### Anti CSRF Token for Tasklist

<!-- https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3672 -->

Tasklist sessions are now protected via an [anti CSRF token](/self-managed/tasklist-deployment/tasklist-configuration.md#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).
