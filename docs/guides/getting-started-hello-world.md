This guide walks you through deploying and running a fully automated BPMN process — no code, no workers, no forms required. You supply a couple of variables, and the Camunda engine handles everything else using script tasks, gateways, a timer, and a DMN decision table.

If you're new to Camunda or BPMN, don't worry — you don't need any background knowledge. Just follow the steps and you'll have a running process in about 30 minutes.

## What you'll build

A **Rocket Launch** process where you play mission control. You provide fuel level, and the engine handles the rest:

1. Start the launch sequence.
2. Run a pre-flight check.
3. Decide whether systems are **GO** or **NO-GO**.
4. If **GO**: wait for a countdown, plot the destination via a DMN decision, then run two tasks in parallel (burn stage 1 and run experiments).
5. Generate a mission report and complete the mission.
6. If **NO-GO**: cancel the mission and end the process.

Different inputs produce different outcomes:

| `fuelLevel` | What happens                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `>= 90`     | Launch proceeds — destination set to **Venus** (5 experiments) |
| `76 – 89`   | Launch proceeds — destination set to **Mars** (5 experiments)  |
| `75`        | Launch proceeds — destination set to **Mars** (3 experiments)  |
| `50 – 74`   | Launch proceeds — destination set to **Moon** (3 experiments)  |
| `< 50`      | **Mission canceled** — process ends on the cancellation path   |

## What you'll learn

These are the BPMN and Camunda concepts you'll see in action. You don't need to know any of them in advance — this guide introduces each one in context.

| Concept                            | Where you'll see it                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Script tasks with FEEL**         | Five tasks that compute values inline — no external worker needed     |
| **Business rule task + DMN**       | Destination is resolved via a decision table (`plot-destination.dmn`) |
| **Exclusive gateway (XOR)**        | Routes GO vs NO-GO based on `systemStatus`                            |
| **Timer intermediate catch event** | A 10-second countdown — watch the token wait in Operate               |
| **Parallel gateway**               | Engine and experiment tasks run simultaneously                        |
| **Default sequence flow**          | The NO-GO path fires when no condition matches                        |
| **Process variables**              | `fuelLevel`, `destination`, `missionResult`, and more                 |
| **Multiple end events**            | Success or cancellation — different outcomes in the same process      |

## Prerequisites

- [JDK 21–25](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) – required by Camunda 8 Run to start the engine locally.

## Download the Camunda 8 starter package

Download the Camunda 8 starter package from the following website:
[https://developers.camunda.com/install-camunda-8/](https://developers.camunda.com/install-camunda-8/)

The starter package includes the following components:

- [Camunda 8 Run](/self-managed/quickstart/developer-quickstart/c8run.md) – A simplified, single-application Camunda configuration for a local development environment.
- [Camunda Modeler](/components/modeler/about-modeler.md) – An application for modeling BPMN, DMN, and Forms.
- [Getting started project](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-8-get-started) – Example projects including the Rocket Launch process used in this guide.

All of these components are included in the starter package. You do not need to download them separately. The links above are provided for additional information.

## Instructions

<ol>
  <li>
    Unzip the Camunda 8 starter package.
  </li>

  <li>
    Start Camunda 8 Run by changing into the directory and running the command:
    <Tabs groupId="os" defaultValue="maclinux" values={
[
{ label: 'Mac OS + Linux', value: 'maclinux', },
{ label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
] }>
<TabItem value="maclinux">
    ```bash
./camunda-start.sh
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">
```bash
.\camunda-start.bat
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
  </li>

  <li>
    Open the Camunda Modeler application from the starter package.
  </li>

  <li>
    In Camunda Modeler, use:
    <pre><code>File &gt; Open File...</code></pre>
    to open the process model:
    <pre><code>camunda-8-get-started/1-rocket-launch/rocket-launch.bpmn</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    Click the "Rocket" icon in the bottom toolbar of Camunda Modeler to open the deployment dialog.
    Select <code>Camunda 8 Self-Managed</code> and enter <code>http://localhost:8080/v2</code> as the cluster endpoint, then click <strong>Deploy</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Switch back to Camunda Modeler and open the DMN decision table:
    <pre><code>camunda-8-get-started/1-rocket-launch/plot-destination.dmn</code></pre>
    Deploy this file using the same "Rocket" icon, cluster endpoint, and <strong>Deploy</strong> button.
  </li>

  <li>
    Switch back to the <code>rocket-launch.bpmn</code> tab in Modeler and click the "Play" icon on the bottom toolbar to start a new process instance.

Set the following variables to start a mission:

```json
{ "missionName": "Odyssey", "fuelLevel": 95 }
```

  </li>
</ol>

## Watch the process in Operate

Navigate to Operate at [http://localhost:8080/operate](http://localhost:8080/operate) and log in with `demo` / `demo`.

Find the **Rocket Launch** process and click into your running instance.

:::note
Data needs to sync to Operate, so the process instance may not be visible immediately.
:::

**Things to look for:**

- **Timer waiting** — the token pauses at "Countdown T-10" for 10 seconds. You can see it live.
- **Different paths** — compare a successful vs. canceled instance.
- **DMN decision** — destination is set by `plot-destination` based on `fuelLevel`.
- **Parallel execution** — both "Burn stage 1" and "Run experiments" complete independently.
- **Variables** — click an instance and inspect `destination`, `fuelAfterBurn`, `missionResult`.

## Try different scenarios

Go back to Modeler and start additional process instances with different fuel levels to explore the various paths:

| Mission | Variables           | Expected outcome                  |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Venus   | `{"fuelLevel": 95}` | Destination: Venus, 5 experiments |
| Mars    | `{"fuelLevel": 80}` | Destination: Mars, 5 experiments  |
| Moon    | `{"fuelLevel": 60}` | Destination: Moon, 3 experiments  |
| Cancel  | `{"fuelLevel": 30}` | Mission canceled                  |

Compare the paths of successful and canceled instances in Operate.

## How it works

The process uses no external code. All logic is expressed using **FEEL expressions** in script tasks and a **DMN decision table**. You don't need to write or edit these expressions to complete this guide — this section is just a reference if you're curious what's happening under the hood.

| Task             | FEEL expression                                                                                                    | Output variable  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Pre-flight check | `if fuelLevel >= 50 then "ALL SYSTEMS GO" else ...` (sets status to cancel)                                        | `systemStatus`   |
| Cancel mission   | `"Mission " + missionName + " scrubbed — not enough fuel (" + string(fuelLevel) + "%)"`                            | `missionResult`  |
| Plot destination | DMN table: `>= 90` → Venus, `>= 75` → Mars, `>= 50` → Moon                                                         | `destination`    |
| Burn stage 1     | `fuelLevel - 25`                                                                                                   | `fuelAfterBurn`  |
| Run experiments  | `if fuelLevel > 75 then 5 else 3`                                                                                  | `experimentsRun` |
| Mission report   | `"Crew reached " + destination + "! Fuel: " + string(fuelAfterBurn) + "%. Experiments: " + string(experimentsRun)` | `missionResult`  |

## Complete!

Navigate back to Operate and verify that your process instances have completed successfully (or were canceled, depending on the fuel level). Congratulations — you've just deployed and run your first Camunda 8 process!

## Summary

You deployed and ran a fully automated BPMN process by:

1. Running Camunda 8 Run locally.
2. Deploying a BPMN process model and a DMN decision table.
3. Starting process instances with different variables.
4. Observing how the engine evaluated FEEL expressions, routed through gateways, waited on a timer, and executed parallel paths — all without writing any code.

## Next steps

- **Edit FEEL and DMN logic** — tune fuel thresholds in script tasks and decision table rules.
- **Change the timer** — edit `PT10S` to `PT30S` and watch the countdown in real time.
- **Add a new parallel branch** — try adding a third task inside the parallel block.
- **Add a user task** — insert a manual approval step before launch.
- **Run the order process example** — see [Run your first Spring Boot or Node.js project](./getting-started-example.md) for a guide using service workers.

## Teardown

You can stop Camunda 8 Run by executing:

<Tabs groupId="os" defaultValue="maclinux" values={
[
{ label: 'Mac OS + Linux', value: 'maclinux', },
{ label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
] }>
<TabItem value="maclinux">

```bash
./camunda-stop.sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```bash
.\camunda-stop.bat
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
