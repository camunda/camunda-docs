The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.0.x to 8.1.0 for each component of the system.

## Server

### Zeebe

No changes are required to update Zeebe 8.0 to 8.1.
But there are deprecated properties that you should be aware of.
:::note
Even if these parameters are deprecated you can still use them because of the backward compatibility of the Zeebe versioning system.
:::
Deprecated properties:

- Zeebe Gateway's property `contactPoint`
  - Remove the usage of `zeebe.gateway.cluster.contactPoint` property.
  - Use the `zeebe.gateway.cluster.initialContactPoints` property. Note: you can set the list of broker addresses here, to make the start process of the Zeebe Gateway more resilient. Please, refer to [the Zeebe Gateway's configuration](../../../self-managed/zeebe-gateway-deployment/zeebe-gateway/#cluster-configuration) guide for detail.
  - Remove the usage of `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_CONTACTPOINT` environment variable.
  - Use the `ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS` environment variable. Note: you can set the list of broker addresses here, to make the start process of the Zeebe Gateway more resilient. Please, refer to [the Zeebe Gateway's configuration](../../../self-managed/zeebe-gateway-deployment/zeebe-gateway/#cluster-configuration) guide for detail.
