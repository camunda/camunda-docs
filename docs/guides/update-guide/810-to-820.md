<span class="badge badge--primary">Intermediate</span>

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.1.x to 8.2.0 for each component.

## Zeebe

### New configuration for disk usage

A new configuration for [tuning disk usage](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/disk-space.md) is added.
The old configurations are still accepted, but they are deprecated. We recommend using the new configuration.

### Changes to default backpressure

The default [backpressure](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/operations/backpressure.md) algorithm changed from **Vegas** to **additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)**.

:::note
This may change the performance characteristics. If you have tuned your system for specific latency or throughput, we recommend you reevaluate with the new version.
:::

### Operate

- It is recommended to follow a sequential update path when updating to version 8.2. For example, if running on version 8.0, first update to 8.1, then update to 8.2.
- Migration of data during the version 8.2 update could take longer than previous versions, especially for datasets containing a large amount of incidents data.

## Identity

A new feature for Identity has been added called resource authorizations. By default, this feature is disabled. To learn more about this feature see the [resource authorizations concepts page](/self-managed/concepts/access-control/resource-authorizations.md).
