title: Update Elasticsearch 7 to 8
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Elasticsearch 7 to Elasticsearch 8."
---

The Camunda Platform is not compatible with the Elasticsearch 8 Curator. This Curator is used to manage data retention
within Elasticsearch. To upgrade to Elasticsearch 8, the Curator must be replaced with
[Index Lifecycle Management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html)
(ILM). Once the upgrade to Elasticsearch 8 is complete, the Curator can be disabled.

Details on how to configure ILM for Zeebe can be found on the
[Elasticsearch exporter](../../../../self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter#retention) page.

:::note
The Elasticsearch Curator can be replaced with ILM when using Elasticsearch 7 as well. This is useful when incrementally
upgrading from Elasticsearch 7 to 8.
