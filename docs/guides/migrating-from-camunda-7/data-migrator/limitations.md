An overview of the current limitations of the Camunda 7 to Camunda 8 Data Migrator, covering general limitations as well as specific limitations related to variables and BPMN elements.

## Runtime

The runtime migration has the following limitations.

### General limitations

- To migrate running process instances, the historic process instance must exist.
  - You cannot migrate running instances when you have configured history level to `NONE` or a custom history level that doesn't create historic process instances.
  - The minimum supported history level is `ACTIVITY`.
- You must add an execution listener of type `migrator` to all your start events.
- Migration of users, groups, or tenants as well as authorizations is currently not supported.
  - You must ensure that the users, groups, and authorizations are already migrated to Camunda 8 before migrating process instances.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5175
- Data changed via user operations
  - Data set via user operations like setting a due date to a user task cannot be migrated currently.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5182

### Variables

- Proper handling and intercepting of variables is currently only supported for the Runtime Data Migrator.
- [Unsupported Camunda 7 types](../variables#unsupported-types).
- [Camunda 8 variable name restrictions](/components/concepts/variables.md#variable-values).
  - Variables that do not follow the restrictions will cause issues in FEEL expression evaluation.
- Variables set into the scope of embedded sub-processes are not supported yet and will be ignored.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5235

### BPMN elements

Some BPMN elements and configurations supported in Camunda 7 are not supported in Camunda 8 or have specific limitations during migration. Below is an overview of these limitations and recommendations to address them.

#### Elements supported in Camunda 7 but not supported in Camunda 8

See the [BPMN documentation](/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn.md#bpmn-coverage/) for more details on element support in Camunda 8, and adjust your models accordingly before migration.

#### Start events

- It is required that a process instance contains a single process level None Start Event to run the data migrator.
- If a process definition only has event-based start events (for example, Message, Timer), it is required to add a temporary None Start Event. This change must be reverted after the data migration is completed.
- Example adding a None Start Event:

```diff
  <bpmn:process id="Process_1fcbsv3" isExecutable="true">
    <bpmn:startEvent id="StartEvent_1">
      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_FromEventStartEvent</bpmn:outgoing>
      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_1yknqqn" />
    </bpmn:startEvent>
    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_FromEventStartEvent" sourceRef="StartEvent_1" targetRef="ActivityId" />
+   <bpmn:startEvent id="NoneStartEvent">
+     <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_FromNoneStartEvent</bpmn:outgoing>
+   </bpmn:startEvent>
+   <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_FromNoneStartEvent" sourceRef="NoneStartEvent" targetRef="ActivityId" />
    <bpmn:task id="ActivityId">
      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_FromEventStartEvent</bpmn:incoming>
      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_FromNoneStartEvent</bpmn:incoming>
      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1o2i34a</bpmn:outgoing>
    </bpmn:task>
    <bpmn:endEvent id="EndEvent">
      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1o2i34a</bpmn:incoming>
    </bpmn:endEvent>
    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1o2i34a" sourceRef="ActivityId" targetRef="EndEvent" />
  </bpmn:process>
```

#### Async before/after wait states

Camunda 8 does not support [asynchronous continuation before or after](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/transactions-in-processes/#asynchronous-continuations) any kind of wait state. Service-task-like activities are executed asynchronously by default in Camunda 8 - so for example a service task waiting for asynchronous continuation before will be correctly migrated. But if you need to migrate an instance currently waiting asynchronously at other elements in a Camunda 7 model, such as a gateway for example, this instance would just continue without waiting in the equivalent Camunda 8 model. You might need to adjust your model's logic accordingly prior to migration.

#### Message events

- Only message catch and throw events are supported for migration.
- Depending on your implementation, you may need to add [a correlation variable](/components/modeler/bpmn/message-events/message-events.md#messages) to the instance pre-migration.

#### Message and signal start events

- If your process starts with a message/signal start event, no token exists until the message/signal is received and hence no migration is possible until that moment.
- Once the message/signal is received, the token is created and moved down the execution flow and may be waiting at a migratable element inside the process. However, due to how the migration logic is implemented, at the moment the data migrator only supports processes that start with a normal start event.

#### Triggered boundary events

- Camunda 7 boundary events do not have a natural wait state.
- If the process instance to be migrated is currently at a triggered boundary event in Camunda 7, there may still be a job associated with that event, either waiting to be executed or currently running. In this state, the token is considered to be at the element where the job is created: typically the first activity of the boundary event’s handler flow, or technically the point after the boundary event if asyncAfter is used.
- During migration to Camunda 8, the token will be mapped to the corresponding target element. However, if that element expects input data that is normally produced by the boundary event’s job (for example, setting variables), this data may be missing in the migrated instance.
- Recommendation: To ensure a consistent migration, allow boundary event executions to complete before initiating the migration.

#### Call activity

To migrate a subprocess that is started from a call activity, the migrator must set the `legacyId` variable for the subprocess. This requires propagating the parent variables. This can be achieved by updating the Camunda 8 call activity in one of the following ways:

- Set `propagateAllParentVariables` to `true` (this is the default) in the `zeebe:calledElement` extension element.
- Or, if `propagateAllParentVariables` is set to `false`, provide an explicit input mapping:

```xml
<zeebe:ioMapping>
  <zeebe:input source="=legacyId" target="legacyId" />
</zeebe:ioMapping>
```

#### Multi-instance

Processes with active multi-instance elements can currently not be migrated. We recommend to finish the execution of any multi-instance elements prior to migration.

#### Parallel gateways

Process instances with active joining parallel gateways cannot currently be migrated. The migrator will skip these instances during migration.

- This limitation occurs when some execution paths have completed and reached the joining parallel gateway, but other paths are still waiting at activities before the gateway.
- Recommendation: Ensure no token waits in a joining parallel gateway.
- See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5461

#### Timer events

- Timer start events: prior to migration, you must ensure that your process has at least one [none start event](/components/modeler/bpmn/none-events/none-events.md#none-start-events). Processes that only have a timer start event cannot be migrated.
- If your model contains timer events (start and other), you must ensure that no timers fire during the migration process.
  - Timers with [date](/components/modeler/bpmn/timer-events/timer-events.md#time-date): ensure the date lies outside the migration time frame.
  - Timers with [durations](/components/modeler/bpmn/timer-events/timer-events.md#time-duration): ensure the duration is significantly longer than the migration time frame.
  - Timers with [cycles](/components/modeler/bpmn/timer-events/timer-events.md#time-cycle)): ensure the cycle is significantly longer than the migration time frame and/or use a start time that lies outside the migration time frame.
- Note that during deployment and/or migration, the timers may be restarted. If business logic requires you to avoid resetting timer cycles/duration, you need to apply a workaround:
  - Timers with cycles:
    - Add a start time to your cycle definition that is equal to the moment in time when the currently running Camunda 7 timer is next due.
    - You must still ensure that the start time lies outside the migration time frame.
  - Timers with durations:
    - Non-interrupting timer boundary events:
      - Switch to cycle definition with a start time that is equal to the moment in time when the currently running Camunda 7 timer is next due and add a "repeat once" configuration.
      - This way, for the first post migration run, the timer will trigger at the start time.
      - For all subsequent runs, the defined cycle duration will trigger the timer. The "repeat once" instruction ensures it only fires once, similar to a duration timer.
      - You must still ensure that the start time lies outside the migration time frame.
    - Interrupting boundary and intermediate catching events:
      - Add a variable to your Camunda 7 instance that contains the leftover duration until the next timer is due.
      - In your Camunda 8 model, adjust the timer duration definition to use an expression: if the variable is set, the value of this variable should be used for the duration. If the variable is not set or does not exist, you may configure a default duration.
      - This way, for the first post migration run the variable will exist and the timer will set its duration accordingly.
      - For all subsequent runs, the variable will not exist and the default duration will be used.
      - Again, you must ensure the leftover duration for the first post migration run lies outside the migration time frame.

#### Event subprocesses

- Event subprocesses with interrupting start events can cause unexpected behavior during migration if triggered at the wrong moment. This includes timer, message, and signal start events.
- What can go wrong:
  - A task that already ran in Camunda 7 might run again in Camunda 8.
  - The process might end up in the wrong state after migration — for example, being one step behind what you see in Camunda 7.
- When could it happen:
  - This can occur when a process instance is already inside an event subprocess in Camunda 7, and the start event of that same subprocess is accidentally triggered again in Camunda 8 during migration.
- How to prevent it:
  - Don't correlate messages or send signals during migration.
  - Temporarily adjust timer start events in event subprocesses to ensure they do not trigger during migration (see the section on timer events for more details).
  - If above suggestions are not feasible in your use case make sure service tasks are idempotent — so repeating them does not cause issues.

## History

The history migration has the following limitations.

### Process instance

- Process instance migration doesn't populate the `parentElementInstanceKey` and `tree` fields.
- This means that the history of subprocesses and call activities is not linked to their parent
  process instance.
- As a result, you cannot query for the history of a subprocess or call activity using the
  parent process instance key.
- See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5359

### DMN

- The Data Migrator only migrates instances which are linked to process definition business rule tasks.
- The properties `evaluationFailure` and `evaluationFailureMessage` are not populated in migrated decision instances.
- Decision instance `inputs` and `outputs` are not yet migrated.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5364
- Decision instance `state` and `type` are not yet migrated.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5370

## Cockpit plugin

The [Cockpit plugin](/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/data-migrator/cockpit-plugin.md) has the following limitations:

- The migration schema has no authorization mechanism. Anyone with authenticated access to the Camunda 7 Cockpit can see the Cockpit Plugin and read the migration schema.
- If the migration of a process instance or any other entity is skipped for multiple reasons, only one reason is stored and displayed.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5389
- For historic data migration the skip reason is currently only stored for the initial migration attempt. If migration fails again after retry, the skip reason is not updated.
  - See https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5390
- There are currently some UI inconsistencies. See:
  - https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5422
  - https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5423
  - https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues/5424
- The Cockpit plugin doesn't have extensive test coverage yet so we cannot guarantee a high level of stability and therefore don't claim it to be production-ready.
