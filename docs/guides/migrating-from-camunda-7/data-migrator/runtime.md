Migrate currently running process instances.

## About runtime migration

Running refers to process instances in Camunda 7 are not yet ended and are currently waiting in a [wait-state](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/transactions-in-processes/#wait-states). This state is persisted in the database, and a corresponding data entry must be created in Camunda 8, so the process instance can continue from that state in the new solution.

:::info
Camunda is developing the Data Migrator with a first release of the runtime instance migration mode planned for **Camunda 8.8 (October 2025)**. You can already use existing alpha releases. Iterative improvements will follow. You can check the current state and track progress in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-7-to-8-data-migrator).

## Requirements and limitations

The following requirements and limitations apply:

<!-- TODO this is an important deep link - we need to create a headline here -->

- The Runtime Data Migrator needs to access the Camunda 7 database.
- The Runtime Data Migrator needs to access Orchestration Cluster APIs (which means you can also use it when running SaaS).
- You must be familiar with the Data Migrator [limitations](limitations.md).

If you need to adjust your process models before migration, you can use [process version migration](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-instance-migration/) in the Camunda 7 environment to migrate process instances to versions that are migratable to Camunda 8. An interesting strategy can be to define dedicated migration states you want your process instances to pile up in. Another common strategy is to use [process instance modification](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-instance-modification/) in the Camunda 7 environment to move out of states that are not migratable (for example, process instances within a multiple instance task).

<!-- TODO pile up: mention the job pause feature in Camunda 7 -->

To use the Runtime Data Migrator, every Camunda 8 process model must have:

- A process-level **None Start Event**, and
- An execution listener on that **None Start Event** with the type `migrator` (or a validated job type, see below).

Example:

```xml
<bpmn:startEvent id="StartEvent_1">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:executionListeners>
      <zeebe:executionListener eventType="end" type="migrator" />
    </zeebe:executionListeners>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:startEvent>
```

## Choreography

The runtime migration typically follows these phases:

### 1. Preparation

- Stop Camunda 7 process execution to avoid starting new instances during migration.
- Migrate BPMN models using the [Migration Analyzer & Diagram Converter](/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/migration-tooling.md#migration-analyzer--diagram-converter).
- Add required `migrator` execution listeners to None Start Events in Camunda 8 models.
- Adjust Camunda 8 models to comply with migration limitations.
- Test migrated models in a Camunda 8 environment.
- Back up your Camunda 7 database before migration.

### 2. Migration

- Deploy Camunda 8 process models and resources to the target environment.
- Configure the migrator with proper database connections and settings.
- Start the migrator and monitor progress through logs.
- Verify results in Camunda 8 Operate.
- Handle skipped instances by reviewing and addressing validation failures.
- After successful migration, clean up models if needed:
  - Remove `migrator` execution listeners from Camunda 8 models.
  - Revert temporary model changes.
  - Migrate instances to the latest version of Camunda 8 models if appropriate.

### 3. Validation

- Check migrated instances in Camunda 8 Operate.
- Verify variable data and migrated state.
- Test process continuation by completing some migrated instances.
- Monitor system performance and resource usage.
- Validate business logic continues to work as expected.

## Validation and skip reasons

The migrator validates each process instance before migration and will skip instances that fail validation for the following reasons:

| Skip reason                           | Condition (why it is skipped)                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing Camunda 8 process definition  | No corresponding Camunda 8 process definition is found for the Camunda 7 process ID.                             |
| Multi-instance activities             | The process instance has active multi-instance activities.                                                       |
| Missing flow node elements            | The Camunda 7 instance is at a flow node that does not exist in the deployed Camunda 8 model.                    |
| Missing None Start Event              | The Camunda 8 process definition does not have a process-level None Start Event.                                 |
| Missing `migrator` execution listener | The Camunda 8 process definition does not have an execution listener of type `migrator` on the None Start Event. |
| Multi-tenancy                         | The tenant ids are not configured in the Data Migrator.                                                          |

When a process instance is skipped:

- The skipped process instance is logged.
- The instance is marked as skipped in the migration database.
- You can list skipped instances.
- You can retry migration of skipped instances after fixing the underlying issues.

### Common resolution steps

1. Deploy the missing Camunda 8 process definition
1. Wait for multi-instance activities to complete
1. Ensure all active flow nodes in the Camunda 7 process have corresponding elements in the Camunda 8 process
1. Modify process instance to a supported state

## Usage examples

```bash
# Run runtime migration
./start.sh --runtime

# List all skipped process instances
./start.sh --runtime --list-skipped

# Retry skipped process instances
./start.sh --runtime --retry-skipped
```

## Job type configuration

During migration, the Data Migrator starts new Camunda 8 process instances and sets a special `legacyId` variable to link them to their original Camunda 7 process instances. The migrator uses execution listeners on start events for its internal migration logic.

However, if users manually start new Camunda 8 process instances on models that still have these migration execution listeners, those instances won't have the `legacyId` variable. This creates a problem:

- The migrator would try to migrate process instances that don't need migration
- This could cause errors or unexpected behavior

The `validation-job-type` feature solves this by allowing you to use a FEEL expression to create different job types for externally started process instances versus process instances started by the migrator. This ensures only instances that truly need migration are processed by the migrator.

The migrator supports two job type configurations with fallback behavior:

- **`job-type`**: Used for actual job activation.
  - This is the primary job type used when activating jobs in Camunda 8.
  - It is required for the migrator to function correctly.

- **`validation-job-type`**: Used for validation purposes (optional).
  - You can define a FEEL expression that provides different job types based on the process instance context.
  - The BPMN process will be validated to contain a start event execution listener with the respectively defined FEEL expression.

**Default Behavior:**
When `validation-job-type` is not defined, `job-type` is used for both validation and activation.

**Basic Configuration:**

```yaml
camunda.migrator:
  job-type: migrator # Used for both validation and activation
```

**Separate Validation and Activation:**

```yaml
camunda.migrator:
  job-type: migrator # Used for activation
  validation-job-type: '=if legacyId != null then "migrator" else "noop"' # Used for validation with FEEL expression
```

**Important notes:**

- If `validation-job-type` is not defined, `job-type` is used for both purposes.
- The `job-type` is always used for job activation.
- The `validation-job-type` can be a FEEL expression (starts with `=`).
- Set `validation-job-type` to `DISABLED` to disable job type validation entirely.
- Use FEEL expressions only for validation, not for job activation since on job activation, the FEEL expression is already evaluated to a static value.
- You can use variables like the special variable `legacyId` in FEEL expression.

**FEEL Expression Requirements:**
When using FEEL expressions in the `validation-job-type` property, you must also specify the same expression in the execution listener of your BPMN process start events. The migrator configuration alone is not sufficient.

Example BPMN configuration for FEEL expression validation:

```xml
<bpmn:startEvent id="StartEvent_1">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:executionListeners>
      <zeebe:executionListener eventType="end" type="=if legacyId != null then &quot;migrator&quot; else &quot;noop&quot;" />
    </zeebe:executionListeners>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:startEvent>
```

### Externally Started Process Instances

Migrator jobs for externally started process instances (process instances not started by the Data Migrator) are activated but not further processed by the Data Migrator since these process instances do not contain the `legacyId` variable that the migrator uses to identify instances that need migration. After the default lock timeout the jobs will be available again for activation.

When using FEEL expressions such as `=if legacyId != null then "migrator" else "noop"` in the execution listener, externally started process instances will generate jobs with the type `noop` instead of `migrator`. To handle these jobs properly, you must implement a **noop job worker** that simply activates and completes these jobs without performing any migration logic.

Example noop job worker implementation:

```java
@JobWorker(type = "noop")
public void handleNoopJobs(ActivatedJob job) {
    // Simply complete the job without any processing
    // This allows externally started process instances to continue normally
}
```

This approach ensures that:

- Process instances started by the Data Migrator are handled by the `migrator` job worker.
- Externally started process instances continue their normal execution flow through the `noop` job worker.
- Both types of instances can coexist in the same Camunda 8 environment.

## Tenants

- Camunda 7 process instances assigned to no tenant (`tenantId=null`) are migrated to Camunda 8 with `<default>` tenant.
- The default behavior is to migrate only process instances without assigned tenant.
- When migrating process instances, the migrator can be configured to handle specific tenants
  throughout the migration process. Defining tenant IDs ensures that only process instances
  associated with those tenants are migrated. Make sure to create the tenants in Camunda 8 before
  starting the migration.

### How Multi-Tenancy Works

1. **Validation**: Pre-migration validation ensures target tenant deployments exist in Camunda 8
2. **Tenant Preservation**: Process instances maintain their original tenant association during
   migration
3. **Job Activation**: The migrator fetches jobs only for the configured tenants and the default
   tenant when activating jobs

### Example

Use the `camunda.migrator.tenant=ids` [property](/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/data-migrator/config-properties.md#camundamigrator)
to specify which tenants should be included in the migration process. This property accepts a
comma-separated list of tenant identifiers.

```yaml
camunda:
  migrator:
    tenant-ids: tenant-1, tenant-2, tenant-3
```

With this configuration, only process instances associated with `tenant-1`, `tenant-2`, `tenant-3`,
and `<default>` will be created and migrated. Instances associated with other tenants will be skipped.

## Dropping the migration mapping schema

The migrator uses the `{prefix}MIGRATION_MAPPING` table to keep track of instances.

If you wish to drop this table after migration is completed, you can use the `--drop-schema` flag when starting the migrator. This will drop the migration mapping schema on shutdown if the migration was successful (no entities were skipped).

```bash
# Migrate and drop the migration mapping schema on shutdown if migration was succcesful
./start.sh --runtime --drop-schema
```

If you wish to drop the table regardless of the migration status, you can use the `--force` flag in combination with `--drop-schema`. This will perform the drop in all cases.

```bash
# Migrate and force drop the migration mapping schema on shutdown
./start.sh --runtime --drop-schema --force
```

:::warning
Using `--force` can lead to data loss. Use with caution.
